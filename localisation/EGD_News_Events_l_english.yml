 WorldNews.1.d:0 "Following nearly two weeks of radio silence from Beijing after what neighboring countries registered as nuclear strikes, the military emergency government of the PRC has confirmed these reports. Nearly 6 months ago, following the sudden death of Chinese paramount leader Deng Xiaoping, the so-called 'Beijing Council' of the CPC-Transhumanist wing installed an experimental central planning Artificial Intelligence known as the \"Long March\" as the central authority in the country. A fault in the hardware sent the program prematurely detonating the entirety of China's nuclear arsenal in their silos. As much of the country now lies in ruins, and separatist groups strike to establish their independence, the PLA Emergency Council assures that order will be restored imminently."

 WorldNews.48.d:0 "After the official signing of the treaty in Washington D.C on the 26th of March 1979, the Egypt-Israel peace treaty has finally come into effect. The two states have restored diplomatic relations, which were suspended approximately 30 years ago in view of the Arab-Israeli war. This treaty mandates the withdrawal by Israel of its armed forces and civilians from the Sinai Peninsula, which Israel had captured during the Six-Day War in 1967,  and ultimately the demilitarization of the Sinai Peninsula. The agreement also provides for free passage of Israeli ships through the Suez Canal, and recognition of the Strait of Tiran and the Gulf of Aqaba as international waterways. Although the treaty has come with great benefits for both nations, the rest of the Arab world has received the treaty with enormous controversy. It is only a matter of time for the world to see if this treaty will be effective for the stabilization of the region."

Palestinians rushed to the streets to celebrate the IDF's withdrawal and their de facto independence from Israeli rule. While Israeli authorities portrayed the move as a gesture of goodwill, it is clear that the overwhelming Palestinian resistance that has culminated in recent years has played a huge role in this unexpected outcome. Even though this move has made significant progress towards international recognition of a Palestinian state, there are still several elements that remain unresolved, such as the question of Jerusalem."

Such is the case of Rankovic, who was driven to suicide by the uncontrollable riots and instability. This occasion put the nation in such a shock that the JNA immediately imposed and started to enforce martial law. The military was also surprised by the Republic of Slovenia, which attempted to seize the situation for herself and declared an independent state. Their attempt was crushed by the Yugoslav military, who acted quickly and effeciently, defusing the threat immediately.It is now unclear for how long can the JNA balance on the thin rope,with resistance growing more than ever."

 WorldNews.54.t:0 "Establishment of SR Kosovo"
 WorldNews.54.d:0 "In a spree of a reformist agenda, Milovan Đilas, on the behalf of the Yugoslav parliament, made the decision to declare and recognize the Socialist Autonomous Province of Kosovo. This radical shift of policy is a breath of hope for Yugoslavia, as the old rule is being replaced by a new and healthy regime. The recognition of SR Kosovo is without a doubt an attempt to stabilize the situation in the Balkans and to prevent any ethnic conflict which could derail Yugoslavia from the path of development and prosperity."
