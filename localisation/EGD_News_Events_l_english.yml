 WorldNews.1.t:0 "Nuclear Detonations Reported in the PRC"
 WorldNews.1.d:0 "Following nearly two weeks of radio silence from Beijing after what neighboring countries registered as nuclear strikes, the military emergency government of the PRC has confirmed these reports. Nearly 6 months ago, following the sudden death of Chinese paramount leader Deng Xiaoping, the so-called 'Beijing Council' of the CPC-Transhumanist wing installed an experimental central planning Artificial Intelligence known as the \"Long March\" as the central authority in the country. A fault in the hardware sent the program prematurely detonating the entirety of China's nuclear arsenal in their silos. As much of the country now lies in ruins, and separatist groups strike to establish their independence, the PLA Emergency Council assures that order will be restored imminently."
