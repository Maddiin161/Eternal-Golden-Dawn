 WorldNews.1.d:0 "Following nearly two weeks of radio silence from Beijing after what neighboring countries registered as nuclear strikes, the military emergency government of the PRC has confirmed these reports. Nearly 6 months ago, following the sudden death of Chinese paramount leader Deng Xiaoping, the so-called 'Beijing Council' of the CPC-Transhumanist wing installed an experimental central planning Artificial Intelligence known as the \"Long March\" as the central authority in the country. A fault in the hardware sent the program prematurely detonating the entirety of China's nuclear arsenal in their silos.

 WorldNews.48.d:0 "After the official signing of the treaty in Washington D.C on the 26th of March 1979, the Egypt-Israel peace treaty has finally come into effect. The two states have restored diplomatic relations, which were suspended approximately 30 years ago in view of the Arab-Israeli war. This treaty mandates the withdrawal by Israel of its armed forces and civilians from the Sinai Peninsula, which Israel had captured during the Six-Day War in 1967,  and ultimately the demilitarization of the Sinai Peninsula. The agreement also provides for free passage of Israeli ships through the Suez Canal, and recognition of the Strait of Tiran and the Gulf of Aqaba as international waterways. Although the treaty has come with great benefits for both nations, the rest of the Arab world has received the treaty with enormous controversy. It is only a matter of time for the world to see if this treaty will be effective for the stabilization of the region."

While Israeli authorities portrayed the move as a gesture of goodwill, it is clear that the overwhelming Palestinian resistance that has culminated in recent years has played a huge role in this unexpected outcome. Even though this move has made significant progress towards international recognition of a Palestinian state, there are still several elements that remain unresolved, such as the question of Jerusalem."
