MEX_ghost_of_echeverria_desc:0 "Unlike basically every Mexican president since Lázaro Cárdenas himself, Luis Echeverría Álvarez did not retire from politics completely after his term ended in 1976. Instead of that, much like the former president Plutarco Elías Calles, Echeverría continues to hold a surprising amount of power over PRI, retaining his status as the most powerful man in Mexico even after he left all elected offices.\nNominally, Echeverría is no longer in any public office, having retired after his term ended. In reality, however, Echeverría keeps his influence via an extensive network of allies and contacts, having appointed hus protégé Juan José Bremer as Secretary-General of PRI, essentially giving himself the power to hand out jobs and political offices to his allies. As such, Echeverría is known to push through his candidates against the wishes of the people nominally in power, often leading to internal clashes.\nIf anyone is to wrestle control away from Echeverría, it means removing the pro-Echeverría triarchy - Juan José Bremer, Secretary-General of PRI ensuring PRI remains loyal to Echeverría above anybody else, Alejandro Gertz Manero, head of the Dirección Federal de Seguridad (DFS) secret police and the man responsible for keeping all anti-Echeverrístas locked away, and Adolfo Aguilar Zínser, leader of the Institute for Economic and Social Studies, the institution responsible for economic and development planning, who allows Echeverría to de facto control the economy."
