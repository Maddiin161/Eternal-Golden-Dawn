 MEX_ghost_of_echeverria_desc:0 "Unlike basically every Mexican president since Lázaro Cárdenas himself, Luis Echeverría Álvarez did not retire from politics completely after his term ended in 1976. Instead of that, much like the former president Plutarco Elías Calles, Echeverría continues to hold a surprising amount of power over PRI, retaining his status as the most powerful man in Mexico even after he left all elected offices.\nNominally, Echeverría is no longer in any public office, having retired after his term ended. In reality, however, Echeverría keeps his influence via an extensive network of allies and contacts, having appointed hus protégé Juan José Bremer as Secretary-General of PRI, essentially giving himself the power to hand out jobs and political offices to his allies. As such, Echeverría is known to push through his candidates against the wishes of the people nominally in power, often leading to internal clashes.\nIf anyone is to wrestle control away from Echeverría, it means removing the pro-Echeverría triarchy - Juan José Bremer, Secretary-General of PRI ensuring PRI remains loyal to Echeverría above anybody else, Alejandro Gertz Manero, head of the Dirección Federal de Seguridad (DFS) secret police and the man responsible for keeping all anti-Echeverrístas locked away, and Adolfo Aguilar Zínser, leader of the Institute for Economic and Social Studies, the institution responsible for economic and development planning, who allows Echeverría to de facto control the economy."
### Leaders ###
 POLITICS_PORTILLO_DESC:0 "José López Portillo is known for many things. Competency, however, is not one of them.\nA childhood friend of Luis Echeverría Álvarez, López Portillo had joined PRI in 1959, although he never served in any elected office prior to his presidency. Instead, he worked within the internal structures of the party, culminating in becoming the Secretary of Finance and Public Credit in 1973, during Echeverría's presidency. Although his period in government was accompanied with a series of corruption scandals, high economic growth managed to keep Portillo's popularity high. It was only natural that it was he whom Echeverría chose as his successor in 1976.\nAt first, Portillo enjoyed high approval ratings, thanks to continued economic boom, fueled by discovery of new oil deposits. However, his controversial appointing of relatives to positions of power, worsened with constant corruption affairs, started to nibble away his popularity. This coincided with a sudden crisis in 1978, when a drop in oil prices nearly caused Mexico to default on foreign debt.\nAt first, Portillo attempted to solve the crisis by privatisation of a number of companies - the plan backfired, and Mexico entered 1979 in a recession. With the midterm elections coming up and PRI facing a very real threat of loss of control over the parliament, his minister of Finance David Ibarra Muñoz suddenly found himself arrested by the DFS, and all economic planning fell to Echeverría's protégé Adolfo Aguilar Zínser. Echeverría then promptly removed Portillo loyalists from his positions, and his allies enforced Echeverría's vision for Mexico - renationalisation of privatised companies, with emphasis on state planning and increasing automation. Combined with increased repression, this allowed PRI to win easily. For Portillo, however, this meant loss of all power - Echeverría managed to control the country without controlling the presidency. Since then, Portillo resigned himself to making speeches and showing occasional video of himself boxing or swimming to push his "macho" image, knowing full well he's no longer the one in charge."
 POLITICS_CARDENAS_JR_DESC:0 "The son of the legendary general and president Lázaro Cárdenas, Cuauhtémoc Cárdenas inherited his father's passion for serving the people. Following in his footsteps, he never hid his left-wing and democratic ideals.\nSome criticise Cárdenas for being a populist, a spoiled child or even a cryptocommunist - however, most people have a rather good opinion of the man, regardless of their ideology. As the leader of the "Democratic Current" within PRI, Cárdenas has led movement for PRI to democratise and embrace the democratic socialist ideals of his father for years, and the work has finally paid off. As the leader of Mexico and PRI's leftist faction, Cárdenas has the difficult, but by no means impossible task - to rekindle the ideals of the Mexican Revolution. It remains to be seen whether Cárdenas will live up to his father's legacy and join him among the most beloved presidents, but one is certain. With Cárdenas at the helm, change will come."
 POLITICS_PANIAGUA_DESC:0 "A son of the great revolutionary general Marcelino García Barragán, Javier García Paniagua was destined to enter politics. With his perfect ancestry and political acumen, García Paniagua was always going to reach the highest posts, and this was only further certified when his father served as the Minister of Defence between 1964 and 1970. This all but handed the position of a Senator to Paniagua, and most kids of rich and influential parents would settle for that. However, Paniagua showed an excellent talent for politics, standing out amongst the nepotism-filled higher echelons of PRI. Catching the interest of Luis Echeverría himself, Paniagua was suddenly catapulted into highest politics in 1976, right before Echeverría "handed over" the power to José López Portillo, having been appointed the head of the DFS, Mexico's secret service. In this capacity, he duly kept close tabs on all the corruption in Portillo's administration, playing a crucial role in 1979, when the latter's administration was struck by a series of scandals and Portillo was forced to reshuffle the cabinet, bringing in Echeverría's loyalists. Paniagua himself came out much stronger from the whole affair - as the new Minister of the Interior, he carried on his campaign against corruption.\nSelected by PRI to succeed Portillo in 1982, Paniagua represents the centrist, nationalist faction of PRI, favouring continuation of previous policies. However, Paniagua also has to adapt PRI to the modern era, to allow it to survive in this day and age. His vision for PRI is much different from Echeverría's, though - and it seems inevitable that the two allies will end up fighting each other in a duel over Mexico."
 POLITICS_DE_LA_MADRID_DESC:0 "Miguel de la Madrid Hurtado is an anomaly. Unlike his predecessors, de la Madrid is neither charismatic nor descended from the leaders of the Mexican Revolution. Ironically, he's the one promising to change Mexico the most.\nCompared to his charismatic predecessors, de la Madrid is a total nobody. An unremarkable bureaucrat, de la Madrid was born to a family with no connection to PRI, and he himself spent most of his career at the Bank of Mexico, with occasional professional detour as an economics professor at a number of universities. The latter part is rather ironic - de la Madrid himself was partially educated at Harvard University, making his stints in central Mexican institutions somewhat controversial, as PRI governments tended to frown upon Yanquí-educated individuals. Still, his abilities made him the Deputy Secretary of Finance and Public Credit in 1975, where he proved himself by managing Mexico's debt and inflation levels. However, disgusted with the incompetency, nepotism and new levels of corruption in Portillo's administration, de la Madrid resigned from the post in 1977, returning to his apolitical job at the Bank of Mexico.\nDe la Madrid was unexpectedly returned to prominence in 1979, with the arrest of Ibarra. As Echeverría redid the government according to his views, de la Madrid was appointed the new Secretary of Economy, a new post created out of the castrated corpse of the previous ministry. Now, de la Madrid only ruled over the sectors of the economy without central planning, making him the de facto leader of private sphere. He turned out to be quite capable in this area, and his popularity skyrocketed.\nElected on a campaign of "Technocratic Mexico", de la Madrid promises to appoint individuals based on their abilities rather than ideology, and claims to be purely pragmatic, technically apolitical individual. How successful can his plans be? Only time will tell."
