ussr.20.t:0 "A letter from Khomeini himself"
ussr.20.d:0 "Early this morning, several Iranian diplomats requested a meeting General Secretary Gorbachev at Sheremetyevo International. The contents of the meeting were to discuss a letter written by the Ayatollah Khomeini. Over the course of few hours, the translators describe Khomeini's request of the USSR abandoning communism and replacing it with an Islamic republican system. The Ayatollah writes, 'Mr. Gorbachev! It is clear to everybody that from now on communism will only have to be found in the museums of world political history, for Marxism cannot meet any of the real needs of mankind. Marxism is a materialistic ideology and materialism cannot bring humanity out of the crisis caused by a lack of belief in spirituality the prime affliction of the human society in the East and the west alike.' An interesting request at the very least..."

ussr.21.t:0 "The USSR begins the Islamic Transition"
ussr.21.d:0 "In broad sweeping changes to the Soviet system, the Supreme Soviet and local sub-councils have been replaced with the Supreme Islamic Majlis, with all instances of Marxism being removed from public buildings. Member of the CPSU have already called against this action as antithetical to the foundation of the Soviet Union and the October Revolution."

ussr.22.t:0 "Establishment of the USIR"
ussr.22.d:0 "Official as of January 1st, 1990, the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics has signed into act a new constitution, affirming it as an Islamic state under the guardianship of the jurists. In what can only be described as a surprising turn of events, the newly formed Union of Soviet Islamic Republics is now the second major power to convert its system of governance to an Islamic system. Despite the vast ethnic and religious makeup of the country, Muslims in Chechnya and Dagestan have supported the new constitution while the Eastern Orthodox Church has decried it as a further violation of Russian religion."

#### FOCUSES ####

SOV_brezhnev_doctrine:0 "Brezhnev Doctrine"
SOV_brezhnev_doctrine_desc:0 "The General Secretary has made this clear - Capitalistic reforms within the Eastern Bloc will not be allowed. A threat to Socialism in one state is a threat to Socialism in them all. Any backsliding, any move towards Capitalism, is a concern for the whole bloc, and military force is justified to preserve the Revolution - for the sake of the Socialist system as a whole."
SOV_era_of_stagnation:0 "Era of Stagnation"
SOV_era_of_stagnation_desc:0 "For the Soviet economy, growth is nothing but a pipe dream. For over ten years the economy has seen little to no growth in production or any growth in the consumer industry. Moreover, with most government spending going to the army, industrial grants are scarce. The funds given are only enough to sustain the current industrial facilities.  §RThis stagnation cannot go on.§!"
SOV_widespread_alcoholism:0 "Widespread Alocoholism"
SOV_widespread_alcoholism_desc:0 "Life in the Soviet Union isn’t easy or enjoyable for the average worker. Military overspending, economic stagnation, and everyday stress have taken a toll on the ordinary citizen. Any way to numb the stress of life has pushed the workers to turn to the easily accessible alcohol of the revolution, vodka. If any recovery attempts of the economy happen, the root issue on why workers turn to the bottle must be dealt with."
SOV_homeland_of_the_revolution:0 "Homeland of the Revolution"
SOV_homeland_of_the_revolution_desc:0 "Russia’s land is soaked with the blood of revolutionaries who’ve given up their lives to ensure the revolution's success against Tsar Nicholas II. These same revolutionaries who bravely defended their ideals against the forces of fascism. This mindset has continued to this day. Citizens and soldiers alike stand together against any threat to socialism, whatever it may be. Glory to the Motherland!"
SOV_bloated_military:0 "Bloated Military"
SOV_bloated_military_desc:0 "No one can say the Soviet military isn’t ready to defend the Motherland, not one person. But with this readiness comes sacrificing the consumer economy and any decent investments into social programs for those at risk. The military is just too big and too overfunded for its own good. §RFailure to curb this overspending may destabilize the entire system.§!"
SOV_1977_constitution:0 "1977 Constitution"
SOV_1977_constitution_desc:0 "The recent amendment of the constitution stands as another step towards political reform within the Soviet Union. For the first time in Soviet history, the  Chairman of the Supreme Soviet was formally assigned powers and, including the powers to negotiate with foreign nations and set the legislative agenda. In addition, the new amendments made an active effort to include the voices of a broad range of all classes, from the coal miner to the scientist through the promise of multi-candidate elections. In addition, the new constitution added clauses giving more rights to each Union Republic, including the right to secession if worst comes worst. In terms of the rights of the people, the constitution provides a broad range of freedoms, from the right to worship to the freedom of artistic work. Nevertheless, there is much to be done in terms of true freedom for the workers, as despite the on-paper protections, true free speech, expression, elections and press still remain unrealized goals. May Lenin smile upon the Soviet Union!"
SOV_kgb:0 "The KGB"
SOV_kgb_desc:0 "The KGB can pride itself on its methods of information gathering and extraction. This is because the tried and true methods of espionage and torture have stayed true to them for this long. But unfortunately, the same cannot be said about their analyzing techniques. Any information gained quickly loses its usefulness as it takes far too long for any operation to be undertaken after the fact. This results in a higher loss of assets than is to be expected. An investment into espionage technology and better file organization should improve the situation."

#### LEADERS ####
SOV_leonid_brezhnev_desc:0 "Leonid Brezhnev was born on December 19th 1906 to a working-class family in Kamenskoye, Ukraine. After the Revolution, joined the Communist party's youth league in 1923 before becoming an official party member in 1929. When Nazi Germany invaded the Soviet Union in June 1941, he joined the Red Army as a commissar and rose rapidly through the ranks to become a major general during World War II. Brezhnev was promoted to the party's Central Committee in 1952 and rose to become a full member of the Politburo by 1957. By 1963, he had accended to Secretary of the Central Committee, positioning him as Khrushchev's likely successor. In 1964,  Brezhnev and several other high ranking Politiburo members appealed to the Central Committee, blaming Khrushchev for economic failures, and accusing him of voluntarism and immodest behavior. After deft poltiical maneuvering, Brezhnev had cemented his power over the USSR. Under Brezhnev's guidance, the USSR has reached the peak of it's power, with victories over the United States in Vietnam to consolidating their control over the Eastern Bloc. Domestically though, while living standards have been higher than ever, it seems that stagnation and corruption have gripped the Union. As Brezhnev grows older and older and the crows of the Politburo claw at his heels, it seems uncertain whether he can last much longer."
