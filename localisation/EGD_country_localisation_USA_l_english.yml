USA_the_societal_revolution_idea:0 "The Societal Revolution"00
USA_the_societal_revolution_idea_desc:0 "The Sexual Revolution is in full swing within America, for better or worse.  Sex has become more common a topic within conversations, and the de-stigmatization of members of the LGBT community is seeing its first steps in progress. However, the more social conservative population looks on in horror as they see a moral degeneracy against their traditional values. Furthermore, the misconception of  GRID(Gay-Related-Immune-Deficiency) and the belief that it only infects those in the LGBT community has only reinforced the conservatives' view on them.\n\nWomen have seen an increase in autonomy regarding their bodies and opportunities. The decision made in the Roe V Wade case back in 73’ has protected and enforced the right for a woman to decide to get an abortion or not. Moreover, as more women enter the workplace, the demand for equal legal rights in marital, family, housing, and educational institutions has risen considerably."
USA_decaying_cities_idea:0 "Decaying Cities"
USA_decaying_cities_idea_desc:0 "The urban crisis of the 1970s continues to escalate in the 1980s, with huge riots occurring in many cities every summer. The postwar suburbanization boom has left America's concrete jungles neglected. With the white middle-class gradually evacuating the tattered cities, the rundown housing is starting to get piled up with lower classes, resulting in high unemployment, overpopulation and high crime rates. Drugs are the most lucrative industry in the inner-city, with well-funded, well armed gangs fighting for dominance on the market."
USA_sun_belt_idea:0 "The Sun Belt"
USA_sun_belt_idea_desc:0 "In the last 10 years, population and incomes have increased steadily throughout much of the Sunbelt because of the continuous migration from the Rustbelt to the South. A rising demand for Southern amenities and increases in housing supply has brought industrial and economic growth to the states areas, leading to a surge of conservatism in those areas."
USA_conflicts_in_washington_idea:0 "Conflicts in Washington"
USA_conflicts_in_washington_idea_desc:0 "A lack of cooperation, insults, and missed phone calls has lead to an constant deadlock in congress, the president has not been subtle about his unwillingness to conform to Washington's rules.\nHe is known for not returning political favors, which has led to a great deal of distrust among the senators due to his behavior.\n\nThere hasn't been any progress made, congress dislikes Carter and Carter dislikes congress, and many don't expect the situation to improve anytime soon.\nIt will greatly damage Carter's chances of being reelected if he does not reconcile."
USA_american_malaise_idea:0 "American Malaise"
USA_american_malaise_idea_desc:0 "Outsiders might see America as a shining beacon of democracy and civilization, but even a fool would see through this thin facade once they had set foot in the land of the free.\n\nThe economy is sinking, soldiers are dying in foreign conflicts, cities are full of the jobless, crime is soaring, and Americans are feeling the post-war haze of victory fading away, and extremists are lurking everywhere like hyenas.\nThe societal cracks in the U.S. are becoming more visible by the day.\n\nThe US will vanish from history if it does not start recovering soon from this decay."
USA_echos_of_the_terrorist_generation_idea:0 "Echos of the Terrorist Generation"
USA_echos_of_the_terrorist_generation_idea_desc:0 "The last decades have not been kind to the United States. The Red Scare has cut deep into the psyche of leftist groups of the nation, making them more prone to violent acts, while the right has become incensed by the liberal policies of the last three Presidents. This wave of domestic terrorism reached his peak in the middle of the 70, when the Minutemen group detonated a car bomb near the UN headquarters and the cult of the infamous Manson shot the president only two years later. While the USA has withered the worst of the storm, most of these groups still haven't disappeared, and even in the 80, the threat they pose still loom over America."

USA_hostage_crisis_category:0 "Iranian Hostage Crisis"
USA_hostage_crisis_category_desc:0 "\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBeginning in the fall of 1978, the U.S. embassy in Tehran had been the scene of frequent demonstrations by Iranians who opposed the American presence in the country, and on February 14, 1979, about a month after the shah had fled Iran, the embassy was attacked and briefly occupied. The embassy weathered this assault, during which several of its personnel were killed or wounded, but Iran was in the throes of enormous revolutionary change, which called for a new U.S. posture in Iran. Consequently, by the start of the hostage crisis, the embassy staff had been cut from more than 1,400 men and women before the revolution to about 70. In addition, attempts had been made to arrive at a modus vivendi with Iran’s provisional government, and during the spring and summer the Iranian authorities sought to strengthen security around the embassy complex.\n\n\nThe Current Tensions are:  [per_hostage_tensions_loc]\n\nThe Americans currently are: [per_hostage_american_willingness_loc]\n\nWe are: [per_hostage_iranian_willingness_loc] \n\nThe Balance of Power is currently: [per_hostage_balance_of_power_loc]\n\n§RIf tensions escalate too far, the consequences will be disasterous for both sides!§!"
