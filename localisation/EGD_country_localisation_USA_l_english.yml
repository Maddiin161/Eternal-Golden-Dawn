USA_decaying_cities_idea:0 "Decaying Cities"
USA_decaying_cities_idea_desc:0 "The urban crisis of the 1970s continues to escalate in the 1980s, with huge riots occurring in many cities every summer. The postwar suburbanization boom has left America's concrete jungles neglected. With the white middle-class gradually evacuating the tattered cities, the rundown housing is starting to get piled up with lower classes, resulting in high unemployment, overpopulation and high crime rates. Drugs are the most lucrative industry in the inner-city, with well-funded, well armed gangs fighting for dominance on the market."

USA_sun_belt_idea_desc:0 "In the last 10 years, population and incomes have increased steadily throughout much of the Sunbelt because of the continuous migration from the Rustbelt to the South. A rising demand for Southern amenities and increases in housing supply has brought industrial and economic growth to the states areas, leading to a surge of conservatism in those areas."
