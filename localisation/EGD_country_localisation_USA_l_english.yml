USA_the_societal_revolution_idea:0 "The Societal Revolution"00
USA_the_societal_revolution_idea_desc:0 "The Sexual Revolution is in full swing within America, for better or worse.  Sex has become more common a topic within conversations, and the de-stigmatization of members of the LGBT community is seeing its first steps in progress. However, the more social conservative population looks on in horror as they see a moral degeneracy against their traditional values. Furthermore, the misconception of  GRID(Gay-Related-Immune-Deficiency) and the belief that it only infects those in the LGBT community has only reinforced the conservatives' view on them.\n\nWomen have seen an increase in autonomy regarding their bodies and opportunities. The decision made in the Roe V Wade case back in 73’ has protected and enforced the right for a woman to decide to get an abortion or not. Moreover, as more women enter the workplace, the demand for equal legal rights in marital, family, housing, and educational institutions has risen considerably."
USA_decaying_cities_idea:0 "Decaying Cities"
USA_decaying_cities_idea_desc:0 "The urban crisis of the 1970s continues to escalate in the 1980s, with huge riots occurring in many cities every summer. The postwar suburbanization boom has left America's concrete jungles neglected. With the white middle-class gradually evacuating the tattered cities, the rundown housing is starting to get piled up with lower classes, resulting in high unemployment, overpopulation and high crime rates. Drugs are the most lucrative industry in the inner-city, with well-funded, well armed gangs fighting for dominance on the market."
USA_sun_belt_idea:0 "The Sun Belt"
USA_sun_belt_idea_desc:0 "In the last 10 years, population and incomes have increased steadily throughout much of the Sunbelt because of the continuous migration from the Rustbelt to the South. A rising demand for Southern amenities and increases in housing supply has brought industrial and economic growth to the states areas, leading to a surge of conservatism in those areas."

USA_echos_of_the_terrorist_generation_idea:0 "Echos of the Terrorist Generation"
USA_echos_of_the_terrorist_generation_idea_desc:0 "The last decades have not been kind to the United States. The Red Scare has cut deep into the psyche of leftist groups of the nation, making them more prone to violent acts, while the right has become incensed by the liberal policies of the last three Presidents. This wave of domestic terrorism reached his peak in the middle of the 70, when the Minutemen group detonated a car bomb near the UN headquarters and the cult of the infamous Manson shot the president only two years later. While the USA has withered the worst of the storm, most of these groups still haven't disappeared, and even in the 80, the threat they pose still loom over America."
