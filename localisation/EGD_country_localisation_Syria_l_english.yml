syria.60.t:0 "Syrian Army Purchases Mi-25 Stock"
syria.60.d:0 "Damascus gives the final word on the decision to purchase Mil MI-25’s from the USSR. Such an action could only be viewed as the result of months of debate and political tension between local leaders of Israel and Syria. This decision could be inflammatory to the already stressed relations between the unstable states..."
syria.60.a:0 "A Hind-D? What's a Russian gunship doing here?"

syria.61.t:0 "Syrian Army Purchases T-72 Stock"
syria.61.d:0 "Today Damascus approves a notable military purchase of T-72 main battle tanks from the USSR. This goes in the face of months of debate and political tension between Israeli and Syrian diplomats. Such an act could provoke Israel or indeed the anti-Soviet groups within Syria itself..."
syria.61.a:0 "Russian armor in the desert."

syria.69.t:0 ""
syria.69.d:0 "The radio crackled a weather report, "...heavy fog rolls in, expect delays in traffic in Damascus..."\n\nBassel leaned back in his seat.\n\n"Perhaps the flight will be canceled..."\n\nHe had been looking forward to his ski trip the Alps for weeks. He shifted his chair forward and reached for the telephone, dialing the number for the Damascus International Airport concierge.\n\n"As-salaam ‘alaikum, Damascus International service speaking."\n\n"As-salaam, this is Major al-Assad, please give me the status of my flight to Frankfurt, leaving this morning."\n\n...a brief pause..."

syria.70.t:0 "Bassel al-Assad killed in car accident"
syria.70.d:0 "The eldest son of President Hafez al-Assad of Syria, widely regarded as a potential successor to his father, was killed early today in an automobile accident outside Damascus. Maj. Bassel al-Assad was one of the most popular figures in his father's inner circle and his death comes as a sharp blow to President Hafez. Syrian and Israeli negotiators are scheduled to resume their peace talks next week in Washington, after a four-month suspension. An official statement released in Damascus described the death as a "tragic accident," and said President Assad would attend his son's funeral Saturday in Qardna, the President's birthplace near Latakia, on the Mediterranean coast. Syria has entered a national state of mourning, as Damascus hails the late al-Assad as "the martyr of the country, the martyr of the nation and the symbol for its youth." Bassel al-Assad was 31."
syria.70.a:0 "A blow to the Assads..."

syr.100.t:0 "A change in scenery"
syr.100.d:0 "Buck Johnson stepped off the Learjet in Damascus. His years with the CIA had not been kind to him, and cleaning up the mess that was post-Assad Syria was the latest odd job he'd been assigned to in the middle of nowhere by the State Department. He stepped off the ramp as a black Renault pulled up in front of him, and a youthful mukhabarat officer stepped out.\n\n"Salaam, you must be Agent Johnson, yes?"\n\n"Yeah, that'd be me."\n\n"Very good; we'll take you to the Ba'ath party office nearby to set up."\n\nBuck sighed. It was hot and dry that day, and he missed the balmy tropics of his previous station in Colombia.\n\n"You mind reminding me why the hell I'm even here if the same party that started this fucking mess is still calling the shots?" he asked the officer, still jetlagged from his flight from Richmond, uncaring about the nature of Syrian political intrigue and missing the cut and dry campaign against the FARC.\n\n"The party is headed in a new direction, but still enjoy the support of the people," he responded curtly.\n\nBuck paused before chuckling.\n\n"Ba'ath party, huh? Y'all got a shower party to go along with it?" he asked before laughing heartily.\n\nThe mukhabarat officer didn't seem amused as they stepped towards the Renault."
syr.100.a:0 "'Fucking Americans.'"
