ROM_industrialization_effort_idea:0 "Industrialization Effort"
ROM_industrialization_effort_idea_desc:0 "The Romanian industry under the Five-Year plan has seen it go from a mainly agricultural economy to an urban industrial powerhouse. In addition, efforts have been made to urbanize the population. With the increase in labour-power, growth within the urban centres has seen a noticeable rise in factory output and education. Workers of Romania unite!"
ROM_aggressive_natalism_idea:0 "Aggressive Natalism"
ROM_aggressive_natalism_idea_desc:0 "The party has taken extreme measures to fight the sharp decrease in birth rates within Romania. All contraceptives have been banned, and abortions are only available in an emergency situation. Furthermore, pregnancies are tracked at the hospital under constant Securitate surveillance, and education now encourages larger families and the benefits of motherhood."
ROM_securiate_idea:0 "The Securiate"
ROM_securiate_idea_desc:0 "The Securitate within Romania has been the leading force used to root out dissident movements. This organization has humiliated dissident leaders, public denunciations, and vicious rumours to stir conflict, all in defence of Socialist ideals. Even the intellectuals aren’t safe from a bit of wiretapping if under suspicion."
