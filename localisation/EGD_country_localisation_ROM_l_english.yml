ROM_industrialization_effort_idea:0 "Industrialization Effort"
ROM_industrialization_effort_idea_desc:0 "The Romanian industry under the Five-Year plan has seen it go from a mainly agricultural economy to an urban industrial powerhouse. In addition, efforts have been made to urbanize the population. With the increase in labour-power, growth within the urban centres has seen a noticeable rise in factory output and education. Workers of Romania unite!"
ROM_aggressive_natalism_idea:0 "Aggressive Natalism"
ROM_aggressive_natalism_idea_desc:0 "The party has taken extreme measures to fight the sharp decrease in birth rates within Romania. All contraceptives have been banned, and abortions are only available in an emergency situation. Furthermore, pregnancies are tracked at the hospital under constant Securitate surveillance, and education now encourages larger families and the benefits of motherhood."
ROM_securiate_idea:0 "The Securiate"
ROM_securiate_idea_desc:0 "The Securitate within Romania has been the leading force used to root out dissident movements. This organization has humiliated dissident leaders, public denunciations, and vicious rumours to stir conflict, all in defence of Socialist ideals. Even the intellectuals aren't safe from a bit of wiretapping if under suspicion."

#### LEADER DESC ####
ROM_Nicolae_Ceausescu_desc:0 "Nicolae Ceausescu was born on the 5th of February, 1918 in the small village of Scornicesti as the 3rd Child to poor Romanian Farmers. He became involved in Communism through the workshop of Alexandru Sandulescu, a shoemaker who was an active member in the then-illegal Communist Party. He had been first arrested by age 15, for street fighting during a strike. By the late 30s, he had been arrested numerous times. During the war, he spent time between internment camps and prisons. After the Communists seized power in Romania in 1950, he headed the ministry of agriculture, then served as deputy minister of the armed forces under Gheorghe Gheorghiu-Dej, becoming a major-general. In 1954, Ceausescu became a full member of the Politburo and eventually rose to occupy the second-highest position in the party hierarchy. He was elected general secretary on 22 March 1965, three days after Gheorghiu-Dej's death as a compromise canidate due to party infighting. Initially, Ceausescu became a popular figure, both in Romania and in the West, because of his independent foreign policy, which challenged the authority of the Soviet Union. The 60s and 70s were a period of economic prosperity. However, the mountain of foreign debt that is piling on Romania due to oil mismanagement during the 70s, the falling birthrate, and nepotism within the government threaten to tear the government and very fabric of society apart. Whether Ceausescu can retain his liberal stance or not is yet to be seen."
