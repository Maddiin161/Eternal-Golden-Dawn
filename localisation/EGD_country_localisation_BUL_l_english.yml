#### IDEAS ####
BUL_zhikov_era_idea:0 "Zhikov Era"
BUL_zhikov_era_idea_desc:0 "After purging his rivals from the Politburo, Todor Zhivkov has stood uncontested within the Bulgarian Communist Party. With the threat inside removed, his government avoids the common factionalism that plagues their Soviet counterparts. With his influence over the party, passing reforms and laws is an effortless endeavour."
BUL_economic_stability_idea:0 "Economic Stability"
BUL_economic_stability_idea_desc:0 "The Bulgarian economy has seen nothing but stability over the decade. A booming tourism industry, and benefiting from trade in the black sea has the economy in a stable position when compared to other Warsaw Pact nations. Docks and factories are filled with happy workers making enough to live a comfortable life underneath the red banner of Bulgaria."
BUL_tourist_hub_of_the_eastern_bloc_idea:0 "Tourist Hub of the Eastern Bloc"
BUL_tourist_hub_of_the_eastern_bloc_idea_desc:0 "With its beautiful beaches on the Black Sea, its preserved towns, and even the Alexander Nevsky Cathedral brings tourists from all over the bloc. The Bulgarian tourist industry is not only booming, but solidarity in socialist thought is high. Truly this is a worker’s paradise."

#### LEADER DESC ####
ROM_Todor_Zhikov_desc:0 "Todor Zhivkov was born in the Bulgarian village of Pravets into a peasant family on an unknown date due to fact that the the Orthodox priest that was charged with keeping the records of new births was drunk and forgot to write the date down. In 1928, he joined the Bulgarian Communist Youth Union and in 932, he joined the BWP proper, later serving as secretary of its Second Borough Committee and as a member of its Sofia County Committee. In World War 2, Zhivkov participated in Bulgaria's resistance movement, organizing  the Chavdar partisan detachment around Sofia and coordinated partisan movements with those of pro-Soviet army units during the 9 September 1944 uprising.In 1950, Zhivkov became a candidate member of the BCP Politburo, then led by Valko Chervenkov, leading to a full membership in 1951. Although sharing power with Prime Minsiter Chervenkov, he used the chaos of the Secret Speech to denounce Chervenkov as a Stalinist and had him removed from political life. Zhivkov carried out a policy of relative sociopolitical liberalisation and de-Stalinization after gaining power, seeking to remove what he saw as cults of personality. For the last 20 years, Zhikov has remained at the top of the BCP due to his favorable position with Moscow, as well as the period of political and economic stability seen under his reign. As the roar of the 80s emerges, it seems that Zhikov will lead Bulgaria through another successful decade."
