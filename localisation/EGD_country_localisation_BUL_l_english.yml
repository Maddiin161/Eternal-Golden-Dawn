BUL_zhikov_era_idea_desc:0 "After purging his rivals from the Politburo, Todor Zhivkov has stood uncontested within the Bulgarian Communist Party. With the threat inside removed, his government avoids the common factionalism that plagues their Soviet counterparts. With his influence over the party, passing reforms and laws is an effortless endeavour."
