nep.1.d:0 "The dissastifaction with the ruling monarchy has boiled over in Nepal, as riots broke out in cities across the country. The protests quickly grew in strength, and within hours, the royal government was forced out of Kathmandu, instead taking a refuge in the city of Pokhara.\nThe leadership of the protestors is composed of opposition figures, and is split between the social democratic Nepali Congress and the communist United Left Front. While not calling for an outright overthrow of the monarchy, the protestors demand an end to the Panchayat, a system that banned political parties, replacing them with nominal "direct democracy", and turned Nepal into a de facto absolute monarchy. King Birendra, whose father Mahendra established the system in 1960, is now silent on whether he will negotiate with the protestors."
nep.2.d:0 "The negotiations between the government and the protestors have begun, with the King Birendra himself leading the government delegation. Meanwhile, 4 leaders have emerged on the protestors' part, with some advocating for peace, while others advocate for a violent revolution.\nSince neither King Birendra nor the protestors have shown much willingness to back down, some expect the standoff to last longer than anticipated. Some believe this is due to both sides having a hardline stance, while others claim this is simply a delaying tactic, with the two regimes trying to secure foreign backing.\nWhatever the case, this small group of men now holds the keys to the future of Nepal."
nep.3.d:0 "It seems that peace was simply not to be. For all the attempts at reaching a peaceful solution to the crisis, violence broke out across the country, leading to both the royal delegation and the Jana Andolan leaders to withdraw from the talks. As reports of fighting on the borders mounted, it became clear Nepal did not choose the path of peace.\nNow, both King Birendra and NC-ULF Revolutionary Committee claim to be the rightful government, and have called on their supporters to put down the rebels. For all intents and purposes, this means that Nepal is officially in the state of civil war."
nep.4.d:0 "In a frankly surprising display of diplomacy, the royal and Jana Andolan delegations announced they agreed on terms to restore order. Many have doubted the ability of communists and monarchists to agree on anything, but it appears the idea of bloodshed was so abhorrent to both sides that compromises became viable.\nThe agreement seems to be a middle ground between the two sides - absolute monarchy is to be replaced with a constitutional one, and the Panchayat system is to be abolished in favour of a traditional liberal democracy. This means great concessions from both the royalists and the ULF, and is the closest to what the NC demanded.\nAs peace is restored, the rebels stood down while King Birendra announced new general election. Future may bring many obstacles, but for now, the situation has calmed down."

#### LEADER DESC ####

desc_birendra:0 "King Birendra Bir Bikram Shah Dev was born in 1945 as the first child of King Mahendra. After spending his youth traveling over the entire world, at one point disappearing to live a normal life in a remote Nepali village, before being caught by royal soldiers and "encouraged" to go through with marrying his cousing, Aishwarya.\nNevertheless, in spite of attempts of his father to groom him into a solid leader, Birendra was obviously unprepared to take the reign in 1972, when Mahendra unexpectedly died, aged just 51. Even his ascension showed that Birendra was not about to become the same strong leader as his father - his own coronation had to be postponed until 1975, in order to appease the astrologers. Since then, Birendra tried to do his best to rule Nepal, slowly embracing liberalisation, as the Panchayat becomes increasingly hated by the population. With growing unpopularity of the monarchy, absolutism and stagnation, Birendra is perhaps the last hope of the last Hindu monarchy to retain power."
desc_bahadur_thapa:0 "Some politicians begin their careers as powerful orators and leaders of their communities, others climb up the party ladder to get to the highest post. Surya Bahadur Thapa has done neither, yet climbed to the highest political office in the country 3 times before 1980, alternating between representing the system and being jailed by it.\nBorn in 1928 in a small village of Muga to a relatively well-off family, Thapa was allowed quality education, joining underground student movements fighting for gender and caste equality. Originally determined to be a career bureaucrat, Thapa's career took a surprising leap when he was selected to join the Advisory Council for the then-king Mahendra, who took liking to the young, ambitious civil servant. When Mahendra abolished democracy after a single election and established the Panchayat in 1960, Thapa was promoted as a technocrat to the position of Minister of Finance, and ultimately to Prime Minister in 1963 when paranoid Mahendra lost trust in another technocrat Tutsi Giri. The same paranoia led to Thapa and Giri alternating terms and times jailed on more than one occassion, but Thapa never abandoned his committment to Nepal and its monarchy.\nNow, as the one actually in power, the distinctly non-political PM Thapa is free to finally initiate reforms to strengthen Nepal and its traditional system. Limited democratisation and economic opening is the way forward, the way to save the last Hindu monarchy!"
desc_bhattarai:0 "Krishna Prasad Bhattarai was by many considered to be a have been. One of the leading politicians from the Nepali Congress, Bhattarai was among the top representatives of the 1959-1960 government, the only democratically elected government in Nepali history, before King Mahendra dissolved it and replaced it with Panchayat.\nWhile most of his colleagues disappeared or ended up in jail until their suspicious deaths, Bhattarai managed to escape from the detention camp in 1968, 8 years after his "disappearance". Hiding in the mountains in both Nepal and India, Bhattarai saw his movement destroyed and replaced by the more radical communist revolutionaries.\nHowever, the Nepali Congress never lost ground completely, and as it turns out, moderate socialism is more acceptable to the general public. Now rising up to the position of Prime Minister of Nepal himself, Bhattarai is finally free to reform Nepal as the Congress promised to over 2 decades ago."
desc_bhandari:0 "Madan Kumar Bhandari's childhood was remarkably unremarkable. Born in a tiny village of Dhungesangu, Bhandari had little interest in politics, instead being primarily interested in gaining education. Knowing he could not afford education in Nepal, Bhandari decided to take a trek to India, where education was less based on one's ancestry and more on one's abilities. Little did he know this would change his life and the history of Nepal itself.\nBeing introduced to communism by other students, Bhandari became active in politics, joining student movements and unions, arguing for equality and freedom for the lower classes. Upon returning to Nepal in 1976, Bhandari joined the Communist Party of Nepal, using his charisma to lure new members and climb its ranks. Soon becoming a rising star of revolutionaries, Bhandari became a face of anti-royal and anti-Panchayat movement. In this capacity, he was a natural choice when leaders for the anti-Panchayat uprising were selected.\nNow, Bhandari finally has a chance to implement his unique ideas to transform Nepal to a communist society. While some accuse Bhandari of betraying the communist ideas by rejecting revolutionary violence in favour of multiparty elections, Bhandari can boast about his incredible popularity among the general population and the fact he was selected to lead the revolution not by violence, but by voluntary reforms."
desc_prachanda:0 "Some men simply carry the revolutionary zeal. Where others falter, they carry on, they inspire, they slaughter. No one personifies this better than Pushpa Kamal Dahal, better known under his nom de guerre Prachanda.\nBorn in 1954 into a Brahmin family, Prachanda was originally expected to take on priestly or educational duties, as men of this varna traditionally do. Indeed, Prachanda at first became a teacher, travelling distant villages to provide education to people for whom the educational system was simply too distant. Seeing the poverty surrounding him, however, changed Prachanda, and his lectures soon took a clearly political edge.\nGoing underground after advocating a violent overthrow of the monarchy, which earned him a one-way ticket to a detention camp, Prachanda helped to establish the communist revolutionaries, soon becoming face of the radical wing, opposing the moderate policies of Bhattarai and his wing. Unlike Bhattarai, Prachanda never embraced electoral democracy, and instead advocated revolution in the style of Chairmans Mao and Gonzalo.\nNow, Prachanda has finally won, and removed his enemies. Creating his own "Prachanda Path" ideology, which sees Prachanda as the 6th great Marxist leader after Marx, Lenin, Stalin, Mao and Gonzalo, Prachanda has successfully established a cult of personality rivaling that of his idols, and can now unleash his ideas onto Nepal."
desc_bijukchhe:0 "Sometimes, you don't have to be the best, or the first. Sometimes, all it takes is to be at the right place at the right time. The story of Narayan Man Bijukchhe showcases exactly that.\nBorn in 1939, Bijukchhe became first involved in politics when he joined the CPN to clear the aftermath of the 1954 Rautahat floods. Becoming a rebel after the royal 1960 coup, Bijukchhe briefly fought before his unit was destroyed, and he had to cross the Himalayas on foot to flee to China. Whereas other communists decided to remain there or travel to the USSR, depending on their beliefs, Bijukchhe decided that while USSR might be imperialist, PRC is not all that better, given its lack of support of the Nepali communists, and realised Nepali communists needed self-sufficiency. As a result, to learn precisely, Bijukchhe led his couple of most loyal followers to North Korea, where they studied Juche and its possible application in Nepal.\nWhile his Nepal Workers and Peasants Party remained a fringe group, thanks to its lack of outreach to other areas, when the Jana Andolan began, all of its members rallied in Bhaktapur, making it the first city overtaken by rebels, and taking the Royal Army by such surprise they captured lots of weaponry. Suddenly, Bijukchhe became one of the most important ULF leaders.\nHandling his position with unexpected skill, Bijukchhe managed to outmanoeuvre his opponents, and in spite of his general lack of public support, gained the ability to bring Juche to Nepal. Let us accomplish the revolutionary cause of Juche under Respected Supreme Leader Comrade Narayan Man Bijukchhe!"

NEP_panchayat:0 "Panchayat"
NEP_panchayat_desc:0 "The Panchayat is a system established by the Great King Mahendra in 1960, which replaced the Westminster-style democracy with a partyless, nominally direct democratic absolute monarchy. With the royal's powers unchecked, Mahendra was free to ambitiously start reforms that were meant to bring Nepal to the modern era.\nNaturally, intentions don't guarantee results, and shortcomings of the system made themselves known very quickly - Mahendra paranoia meant that all the enfranchisment of the average Nepalis didn't translate to anything, as the tens of thousands of new representatives held no power. Simultaneously, the proclaimed land reform ended in a failure, as Mahendra could not antagonise the aristocrats too much. As a result, after abolishing the first 5-year plan, which were created for Panchayat, after only 2 years, the system had to reorient. Fortunately, it did this surprisingly well, and since the 3rd plan in 1965, the primary goal was social and economic development. Nepal experienced an economic boom, eradicated malaria, built its first highway, and eased the overpopulation of cities with its rural development and resettlement plan.\nHowever, in spite of these successes, the population is growing tired of the authoritarian Panchayat. The economy has been slowing down, the promised decentralisation has not been delivered, and the authoritarianism means the growing opposition now also has to contend with extrajudicial arrests, unlawful detentions and occassional disappearances. If the system is to survive, it has to change, and change fast."
