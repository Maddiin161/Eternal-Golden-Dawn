SAU_desert_shocked_idea:0 "Desert Shocked"
SAU_desert_shocked_idea_desc:0 "The seizure of Islam's holiest site by Al Ikhwan, the taking of hostages from among the worshipers and the deaths of hundreds of militants, security forces and hostages caught in the crossfire in the battles for control of the site, shocked Saudi Arabia and the entirety of the Islamic world. Although the situation concluded a month before, its consequences are still visible in Saudi society, with stricter religious and security measures being taken."
SAU_righteous_roar_idea:0 "The Righteous Roar"
SAU_righteous_roar_idea_desc:0 "The ongoing sectarian civil unrest in Qatif and Al Hasa, which began in November 1979 and has resulted in over 20 deaths and hundreds of injuries, has been terrible for the government's credibility. If the crisis is not dealt with quickly, a full-fledged Shia uprising may break out."
SAU_custodian_of_two_mosques_idea:0 "Custodian of the Two Holy Mosques"
SAU_custodian_of_two_mosques_idea_desc:0 "Not too long ago, King Khalid and King Faisal enacted the much-needed reforms to modernize the country. Unfortunately, both paid the ultimate price. Now King Fahd alone has to carry on their mission to modernize the kingdom.\n\nSomething is in the air, though; a smell of Khalid's blood. His assassination has put the nation in a state of fright. The regular suspects-Ikhwan and Qatif Shias-both deny any participation. Only the time will tell the story of the brave modernizers."
SAU_and_keeps_flowing_idea:0 "And It Keeps Flowing.."
SAU_and_keeps_flowing_idea_desc:0 "Saudi Arabian Oil Company is a state company focusing on the extraction, processing, and distributing of petroleum and natural gas, which it mines in the land of Saudi Arabia. It stands firm on the market as one of the largest oil companies on the earth. Creating a considerable amount of employment and bringing massive revenues to finance the army, public services, and more of Saudi Arabia, it is an Ace of spades in the Saudi sleeve. Should the international situation develop to Saudi disliking, they might squeeze a few pressure spots by lowering their oil production."
