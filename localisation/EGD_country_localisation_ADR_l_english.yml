#### IDEAS ####
ADR_brain_drain_idea:0 "Brain Drain"
ADR_brain_drain_idea_desc:0 "Compared to other countries in the pact, travel outside the bloc has always been an easily acquired privilege that the workers of austria have been allowed. As a result East Austria has been haemorrhaging intellectual talent and skilled labourers in factories. The industry and research will never recover if the brains of Austria keep defecting to the west."
ADR_nascent_industrial_development_idea:0 "Nascent Industrial Development"
ADR_nascent_industrial_development_idea_desc:0 "With The Formation of East Austria, the industrial sector of the country has been perpetually organizing with no end it sight. The direction of the industry is still up for debate within the Austrian Communist party. Until its decided, factory development will be in purgatory, and the industrial base will slow if no plan is put into action"
ADR_identityless_nation_idea:0 "Identityless Nation"
ADR_identityless_nation_idea_desc:0 "When the 20th century started Austria dominated much of eastern Europe, but as the years went on it was reduced to a fraction of what it once was. Then in 1938 the Anschluss united Germany and Austria, and it remained so for over a decade until the allies crushed the Reich, and thus began another decade of occupation as the Austrian Republic remained in legal limbo. And now as the sun begins to set on the 20th century the people of Austria question what it means to be Austrian, some identify closer with German. But for some, this loss of identity is a chance to forge a new one."

#### LEADER DESC ####
ADR_Franz_Muhri_desc:0 "Franz Muhri came of age during the reign of the Third Reich, after being drafted by the Wehrmacht he'd join an Anti-Fascist group and fight the Nazis for the rest of the war, following the war however he’d go to Moscow and enroll in the CPUSA \"VI Lenin\"institute, the highest political education centre in the Soviet Union.\n\nWhen Muhri returned to Austria he would quickly be promoted through the ranks, and soon was leader of the party, and then the small rump state of East Austria. Murhi found himself in the precarious position of needing to remain in Moscow's favour, more so than any other member of the Warsaw Pact since East Austria was entirely dependent on the Soviet Union, which never wanted Austria split to begin with. Muhri would fight to remain in favour, supporting the Soviets during the Prague Spring, proving himself, and Austria as a whole, to be a useful and worthwhile investment by using the country’s advantageous position to aid the Soviet invasion. Muhri would also remove several members of the Austrian Communist Party to ensure absolute loyalty to Moscow.\n\nAs dawn draws close though, East Austria’s future is uncertain, and Muhri is a pragmatic man, this loyalty to Moscow may not remain intact in these coming times."
