KHM_dissident_movement_idea_desc:0 "Starting from 1977 with the appearance of Charter 77, a manifesto written by 243 people; among them were artists, former public officials, and other prominent figures. On a larger scale, independent activity is expressed through underground writing and publishing. Worringly enough, with a large amount of the student base joining the cause, the campaign against the party could have a chance to boil over to a full-blown anti-communist riot if reforms continue to be rejected."

#### LEADER DESC ####
CAM_norodom_sihanouk_desc:0 "The so-called "King Father", Norodom Sihanouk has spent his entire life fighting for his vision of Cambodia. Although born a royal, Sihanouk only reigned as a king from 1941 to 1955, before abdicating to become a civilian politician. According to him, this was to be closer to the ordinary people. According to his detractors, this was to pursue power when it became clear absolute monarchy wasn't feasible in Cambodia.\nSince 1955, Sihanouk spent most of his time as the true ruler of Cambodia, first as Prime Minister, then as the "Chief of State", a special post created specifically for him that combined royal and civilian powers, whilst creating a one party state with his Sangkum party. Openly sympathetic to the Eastern Bloc, Sihanouk modelled Sangkum to resemble the ruling communist parties while preaching his vision of "Buddhist socialism", a top-down aristocratic welfare state. His policies had brought growth to Cambodia, but at the cost of authoritarianism and growing opposition from both the left, which considered "Buddhist socialism" to be a sham, and the right, which hated Sihanouk's pro-USSR views.\nIt was the support for North Vietnam that ultimately caused Sihanouk's downfall. After his refusal to push away Viet Minh from their bases in the border regions, Cambodia was bombed by the US, harming Sihanouk's hold on his own country. With his reign weakened, General Lon Nol seized the opportunity and overthrew Sihanouk in 1970. Ever since then, Sihanouk leads the FUNCINPEC rebel group, aligning with North Vietnam and the USSR against pro-US Nol and pro-China Khmer Rouge. Naturally, an alliance between a monarch and a communist party is shaky at best, but Sihanouk will not stop at anything to overthrow the illegitimate government... and replace it with his."
KHM_lon_nol_desc:0 "The butcher general, as Lon Nol is known, got into power in 1970, overthrowing the Chief of State, prince Norodom Sihanouk, allegedly due to Sihanouk's pro-Soviet sympathies. However, most people would call that an excuse to get into power.\nIf there's one thing Lon Nol excels at, it's ambition. Going from a mere officer to the highest ranking soldier and then head of state, Nol was always known for his ruthless pursuit of goals. The problem was, Nol was always great at climbing the ladder, but average at best once the climbing stop - whether as the military leader or a political one, Nol performed bluntly and irrationally. His putdowns of uprisings always carry more bloodshed than needed, his policies always upset more people than they please. Nol has the ruthlessness Sihanouk lacked, but none of the ability - while Sihanouk refused to push Viet Ming and rebels away from Cambodia, Nol has been unsuccesfully trying to do so for a decade now. His brutality, however, only made the central government even less capable to fight. Any area beyond Phnom Penh his soldiers venture to simply became enemy territory.\nNol now relies on his grand plan to destroy the rebels with one glorious march, as everyone grows increasingly sick of him. Even his beloved backer, the US, forced Nol to accept Sam Rainsy and his dissident technocrats into his government, for the government to at least gain some semblance of competency. A success for Nol is needed, and it's needed fast, before his rule becomes untenable, and the US replaces him with a better ally."
KRE_sam_rainsy_desc:0 "The journey of Sam Rainsy is a strange one indeed. An economist by education and a businessman by trade, Rainsy became one of the most prominent dissidents supporting reforms under Norodom Sihanouk and then Lon Nol. It could have been his status as one of the richest young Cambodians, or the support he receives from Washington, but miraculously, Nol didn't have Rainsy killed, instead tolerating him at first, before promoting him to government in 1977 after purging the previous minister of finance. Whatever the case, Rainsy turned into an activist that simultaneously worked for the government he criticised.\nHowever, Rainsy's attempts to reform the government into a democratic system have been all for naught. While Nol may have tolerated Rainsy, as he had no other choice, he wasn't a man that would back off and let himself be bossed around. Rainsy soon found himself isolated from anyone but his technocratic clique. The attempts may have been futile, but at least, they did what they could in their positions to improve Cambodia.\nNow, Rainsy grew fed up with Nol. Recognising that the marshal has virtually zero support outside of the military, Rainsy started preparing for a revolution to replace the old despot. All that was needed was opportunity to get rid of the butcher, and replace him with a liberal democratic government. To that goal, Rainsy will ally with anyone and anything - the cost may be high, but democracy is non-negotiable. Whatever it might take, Rainsy will fight for his dream, and nothing short of death could ever halt his efforts."
KRE_mam_sonando_desc:0 "Once a rebel, always a rebel. Mam Sonando was born in 1942 in a relatively well off family, which allowed him to pursue higher education at the best universities. However, Sonando wasn't content with living the lifestyle of a rich student, and turned to business and activism. Starting his Beehive Media Group aged only 18, Sonando began printing his own dissident newspapers and broadcasting his own radio. He quickly became one of the most prominent left-wing activists in Cambodia, arguing for social justice and reporting on excesses of the government.\nUnfortunately, what used got him charged with spreading misinformation and punished with fines laughably small for someone of Sonando's fortune, turned into something that got Sonando charged with treason, punishable by death, in 1970. Unlike Sihanouk, who was willing to give Beehive a pass to seem more democratic and allow criticism to improve the government and let the government have a way of knowing of people's concerns and problems, Lon Nol's new regime had no interest in any of that. After an abortive attempt at fleeing for France, Sonando founded his own guerrilla group, known as BRG, Beehive Rebel Group, espousing social democratic values. Originally a small group of little importance, made up primarily of middle-class Khmers from cities unadjusted to rural guerrilla warfare, the rebels slowly grew, although far behind in number to Khmer Rouge or FUNCINPEC. It wouldn't be until Sam Rainsy's revolt against Nol that brought the two men together - although ideologically opposed, their adherence to democracy was enough to unite Rainsyites and Beehive. Since the beginning of their cooperation, Sonando and Rainsy worked together surprisingly harmoniously, and while the return of elections made them formal opponents, the two still find common ground on any major issue that arises."
PRK_khieu_samphan_desc:0 "Oh God, oh fuck, what have we created... whatever it takes, the monster that is Brother One has to be stopped!\nOne of the highest ranking Khmer Rouge members, Khieu Samphan came from a middle class Khmer family, studying the prestigious University of Paris and ultimately receiving a PhD in economics. While most Khmer Rouge higher ups have been of rather bourgeois background, Samphan always stood out as the most educated and possibly most competent of the bunch. Thanks to his education and skills, Samphan was in charge of Khmer Rouge finances and economic plan for the areas under their control. However, under Pol Pot's insane orders, Samphan's task at fostering prosperity and growth was nothing but impossible.\nHorrified by Pol Pot's increasing insanity and deviation from Maoism, Khieu Samphan, in spite of his rather timid, borderline cowardly nature, became the leader of the interparty group opposed to Pol Pot's leadership. Samphan isn't exactly a soft man himself, and has in fact little problem with ordering policies that cause suffering of millions, but compared to Pol Pot, he was quite quick to gain a following.\nWith his group now having removed Pol Pot, Khieu Samphan is free to finally unleash his vision onto his lands. Dare to think, dare to act!"
SRK_hun_sen_desc:0 "A man of little convictions, Hun Sen has always been a ruthless, ambitions social climber destined for glory. Be it Khmer Rouge or the Vietnamese, Hun Sen will align to anyone if it furthers his goals.\nA son of monk from Kampong Cham, Hun Sen originally pursued a modest career, joining a monastic school. While his family wasn't among the poorest, they lost most of their fortune after a kidnapping of a relative that forced them into selling most of their farmland. Combined with Lon Nol's coup in 1970, Hun Sen understood that he had little future on his current course of life, and instead ran away to join the rebellious Khmer Rouge.\nServing as a soldier and then an officer in the Khmer Rouge, Sen defected when Pol Pot ordered a purge of the pro-Soviet and pro-North Vietnamese wing of the party, bringing his entire battalion with him. Receiving training and equipment in North Vietnam, the new Kampuchean People's Revolutionary Party quickly became a force to be reckoned with. Sen also turned out to be a good butt-kisser, quickly receiving promotions from his new overlords, leaping over many older, more experienced cadres.\nIronically, with the FUNCINPEC proclaiming support to the Eastern Bloc, the communist Hun Sen was forced into coexisting with the man he despises, prince Norodom Sihanouk. This weird socialist-monarchist alliance is confusing for both Sen and Sihanouk, and both men have been clearly looking to remove the other one. When that opportunity arose, Hun Sen seized it - it was time to reject old traditions. Time to build a socialist state where a kingdom once was. Workers of Cambodia, unite!"
KMP_pol_pot_desc:0 "Leader of the Khmer Rouge, Pol Pot is known as probably the most ruthless man in Cambodia. The man who held the guerrillas together with his iron grip, the man responsible for killing thousands and displacing millions. Some see him as their liberator, but most view him with sheer terror.\nA former teacher called Saloth Sar, Pol Pot rose quickly through the ranks of the Khmer Rouge in the 60' and 70', bringing the party firmly on the side of China. Weirldy enough, many have noticed that since purging the pro-Soviet wing, the party seems to have less and less in common with Maoism or communism as a whole, and more in common with traditional feudalism - areas under Khmer Rouge's control have entire cities evacuated, with the population "reeducated" in enormous rice fields. The rule of the party is total, with no discussion or criticism allowed. The membership of the party is highly selective, in a clear deviation from Maoism, and permits only ethnic Khmers or correct origin - any foreigners or members of the former bourgeoisie are instead considered unworthy of membership and, allegedly, unworthy of life.\nIn a peculiar twist, Pol Pot himself is of bourgeois origin - formerly a teacher, he nevertheless started an anti-intellectual campaign that would hardly find an equivalent. Francisco Macías Nguema smiles at you, Pol Pot."
