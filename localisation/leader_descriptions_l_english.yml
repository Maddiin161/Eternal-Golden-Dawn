 leonid_brezhnev_desc:0 "Born into a Russian worker's family, Leonid Brezhnev joined the Soviet Communist party's youth league in 1923. When Germany invaded the Soviet Union in 1941, he joined the Red Army as a commissar and rose rapidly through the ranks to become a major general during the Second World War. Brezhnev was promoted to the Central Committee in 1952 and became a full member of the Politburo in 1957. In 1964 he ousted Nikita Khrushchev and took over as First Secretary of the CPSU, the most powerful position in the Kremlin.\n\nBrezhnev's conservative, pragmatic approach to leadership significantly stabilized the position of the Soviet Union and its ruling party. Whereas Khrushchev regularly enacted policies without consulting the rest of the Politburo, Brezhnev was careful to minimize dissent among the Party membership by reaching decisions through consensus. Additionally, while pushing for détente between the two Cold War superpowers, he achieved Soviet nuclear parity with the United States and legitimized his country's hegemony over Eastern Europe. Furthermore, the massive arms buildup and widespread military interventionism under Brezhnev's regime significantly expanded the Soviet Union's global influence (particularly in the Middle East and Africa).\n\nConversely, Brezhnev's hostility to political reform ushered in an era of societal decline known as the Brezhnev Stagnation. In addition to pervasive corruption and falling economic growth, this period was characterized by an increasing technological gap between the Soviet Union and the United States. Upon coming to power in 1985, Mikhail Gorbachev denounced Brezhnev's government for its pervasive inefficiency and inflexibility before implementing policies to liberalize the Soviet Union. "
 abdul_shahed_desc:0 "Born in the mountainous and secluded Badakhshan Province of Afghanistan in 1961, Abdul-Shahed grew up through the tumultuous 1970s and 80s following the Saur Revolution. Joining the militant ranks of what would later be known as the Taliban, Abdul-Shahed was ostracized and questioned for his radical and nihilistic views on jihad, the role of Islam and the war against the Soviets. With the collapse of the DR Afghanistan, he and his followers soon split from the mujahedeen and retreated deep into the mountains of the Wakhan Corridor. Now as Mullah and Caliph of the country, he rules the state with a cold and bloody fist that shocks even the most hardliner Islamists in the country. His interpretation of Sharia Law and radical anti-imperialism is known as "post-jihad theory," and for Abdul-Shahed, the service of the people is first to the Almighty. Now, he and his followers turn their gaze to the USSR and the United States, the two satans. The invaders will driven from our lands and will meet their deaths in the graveyard of empires."

Comprised of former SAS and COS operators, many of its members were deployed during the African wars of national liberation. There, they were exposed to the atrocities of colonialism and to the works of Marx and Lenin. Many experienced a crisis of faith, deserting the masters they once served and joining forces with the guerillas. Now, they stand as an elite force who works for any fledgling country seeking independence from colonialism and capitalism. Headquartered out of Mozambique and temporarily stationed in Outward Star, the conflicts between them and their more financially dubious 'comrades' have grown."
