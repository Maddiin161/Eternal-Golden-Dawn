##### IDEAS ####
AUS_scars_of_the_werewolves_idea:0 "Scars of the Werewolves"
AUS_scars_of_the_werewolves_idea_desc:0 "In the last days of the Second World War, Austria was a huge stronghold of both the Werwolf and Spinne organizations. Many Nazi officials and members of the NSDAP ended up in West Austria after the end of the war. The supposed "denazification" conducted in the early days of West Austria's existence did not work out at all, and that shows in the present, with the government being full of them and with numerous Neo-Nazi groups often showing their presence."
AUS_the_long_occupation_idea:0 "The Long Occupation"
AUS_the_long_occupation_idea_desc:0 "The limbo in which Austria found itself following Europe's division between the major powers resulted in a long-term occupation before the formal establishment of the West and East. Who Must bear the cost of this occupation? Who else but the Austrian people. Such expenses have completely wrecked the economy of the nascent state West Austria is."
AUS_choked_in_puppet_strings_idea:0 "Choked in Puppet Strings"
AUS_choked_in_puppet_strings_idea_desc:0 "West Austria is an entity completely dependent on NATO. Her sole existence is owed to CIA funding. Many of West Austria’s politicians are political subjects to Washington. Despite the fact that the stalemate has earned them a favorable position in NATO's sphere, the people are nonetheless dissatisfied and wish for a political climate in which they could truly choose their leaders."
AUS_identityless_nation_idea:0 "Identityless Nation"
AUS_identityless_nation_idea_desc:0 "The Austrian West-East split has shown that these new nations lack cultural and historical identities on their own. In contrast to Germany, where the divide has highlighted the diversity of culture and values in different areas of the country, All Austria has ever given to the world was through its unity"

#### LEADER DESC ####
AUS_Norbert_Steger_desc:0 "Steger is a liberal through and through, he is one of the founders of the 'Atterseekreis', a liberal group within the FPÖ, and later became vice-president of the Liberal International, He'd quickly rise through the ranks of the FPÖ and become the minister of commerce under the Peters Regime. In 1979 when Simon Wiesenthal released a report revealing that Fredriech Peters had been a member of a SS Brigade, the international backlash eventually forced Peters to step down, and Steger was one of the men to throw his hat in the following leadership bid, and he surprisingly won over the more traditional nationalists in the party, no small part due to NATO endorsement... and perhaps more then just endorsement, if the theories are to be believed. Steger now stands in a pecarious position, Peters had maintained a careful balance between the Nationalists and Liberals, as well as holding an autocratic rule by preventing the SPÖ-ÖVP from gaining any ground, and now this burden falls onto Steger, who has his own ambitions of a more liberal, free Austria that he must balance with the nationalistic party."
AUS_Kurt_Waldheim_minister_desc:0 "§F\n------------\n\n\n\n\n\n\n £GFX_idea_Minister_Kurt_Waldheim_large \n\n\n\n\n\n§!"
AUS_Otto_Rosch_minister_desc:0 "§f\n\n\n\n\n\n\n £GFX_idea_Minister_Otto_Rosch_large \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n--------------\n§fOtto Rösch started his career as a humble teacher, in an elite Nazi school, tasked with training and teaching the next generation of Nazi leaders. The next generation never came, but Rösch continued. In the years following the war he began helping high ranking Nazis escape justice, beginning to participate in politics again once Austria was split. Rösch always leaned towards the socialist part of national socialist, gaining animosity from the right. Despite this he's been a prominent player in West Austrian politics ever since its founding and currently leads the Nationalist faction of the FPÖ, it's reputation is not helped by whispers of him rubbing elbows with terrorists, especially after an incident in 1975 where he shook hands with a terrorist after they had taken part in a hostage crisis.§!"

#### DECISIONS ####

AUS_fpo_struggle_category:0 "FPÖ Power Struggle"
AUS_fpo_struggle_category_desc:0 "Steger's liberalism has created a major rift in the traditionally nationalist FPÖ, leading to many conspiracies and accusations of Steger being a Zionist puppet or a Warsaw Pact plant to weaken West Austria, or more realistically, NATO Influenced his election after Fredriech Peters stepped down.\nJörg Haider has managed to unite the FPÖ right against Steger and the NATO influenced that got him in his position.\nIt's only a matter of time before this factionalism comes to ahead, but neither group can act too hastily against eachother and risk the FPÖ's autocratic hold over Austria.\n\n\n[aus_fpo_struggle_loc] \n\n[AUS_fpo_struggle_tension_loc]"

AUS_west_war_category:0 "The Austrian Split"
AUS_west_war_category_desc:0 "Shortly before the complete collapse of the Third Reich, The Second Austrian Republic was proclaimed in an attempt to save Austria from the same fate that befell Germany. This would be in vain, mutual distrust between §3Nixon§! and §RStalin§! over what would become of Austria once it was given independence lead to 'The Long Occupation' which would finally end with Austria split in 1963 following an incident that nearly ended in a third world war.\n\n\nRelations are:\n\n\nEast Austria is:\n\n\nWest Austria is aligned with:\n\nEast Austria is aligned with:"
