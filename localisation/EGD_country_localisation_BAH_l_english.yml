BAH_islamic_front_for_liberation_bahrain_idea:0 "Islamic Front for the Liberation of Bahrain"
BAH_islamic_front_for_liberation_bahrain_idea_desc:0 "The Middle East was struck by 2 identical revolutions in 1979; the Islamic revolutions in Iran and Bahrain. The Bahranian revolution was executed by the Islamic Front for the Liberation of Bahrain, an Islamic organization with direct ties to Iran. The uprising succeeded. While the former Iranian leader Shah managed to escape, nobody fled the wrath of the ISLB.\n\nSuccessfully couping the country, the ISLB turned Bahrain into a de facto client state of Iran. But that is not where the story ends. Opposition groups roam the streets of Manama with a clear intention; to chase the Iranian force out of their homeland."
BAH_popular_front_for_liberation_bahrain_idea:0 "Popular Front for the Liberation of Bahrain"
BAH_popular_front_for_liberation_bahrain_idea_desc:0 "While the Islamic Front for the Liberation of Bahrain's storming of the government remains successful, the streets lay in a state of mayhem. Opposition groups roam the avenues of Manama, the most prominent of them being the Popular front for the Liberation of Bahrain, a staunch pro-Soviet strongly left-leaning group led by Abdul Rahman Muhammad Al-Naimi.\n\nThe PFLB is effectively the head of the opposition to the pro-Iranian government. With clear aims to drive the Iranians out and subsequently cause a revolution leading to a proletariat dictatorship, the IFLB has to work swiftly, as the PFLB may rise to power at a moment's notice."
BAH_tale_two_cities_idea:0 "The Tale of Two Cities"
BAH_tale_two_cities_idea_desc:0 "Bahrain, an Islamic Republic with pro-Iranian and anti-Western views, has prioritized military and state security over economic development. On the other end of the spectrum is Qatar, a Sunni monarchy with Western sympathies that has achieved significant economic gains while progressively becoming more reliant on its Western allies for security. This paradox,with Bahrain and Qatar as prime examples, has highlighted the Arab world's disunity as a result of political and religious differences in recent years."
