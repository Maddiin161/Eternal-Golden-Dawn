#### IDEAS ####
DDR_jewel_of_the_warsaw_pact_idea:0 "Jewel of the Warsaw Pact"
DDR_jewel_of_the_warsaw_pact_idea_desc:0 "Of all the Socialist States of the Warsaw Pact, perhaps none is more dear to the Soviet Union than the German Democratic Republic. Boasting long term planning of the economy, a focus on consumer goods, and electronics manufacturing capabilities, as well as being the literal front line of the Communist Bloc, the DDR enjoys warm relations with the Soviets and lots of prestige within Communist circles."
DDR_berlin_wall_idea:0 "Berlin Wall"
DDR_berlin_wall_idea_desc:0 "While the West claims the DDR government as tyrannical for the construction of the wall, the §RAnti-Fascist Protection Rampart§! stands as as a bastion of socialism in the face of barbaric capitalism. In the past, the agents of capital were able to infiltrate the East German homeland, feeding information back to their CIA handlers and whispering lies in the ears of the workers, driving many to immigrate to the West.\n\nFear. No. Longer. For nearly 20 years, the wall has served as a force preventing western aggression and kept the workers safe in their homes."
DDR_soviet_military_dependence_idea:0 "Soviet Military Dependence"
DDR_soviet_military_dependence_idea_desc:0 "Although the National People's Army is theoretically an independent force, in practice it is still subordinated to the Soviet Military. East German forces are expected to listen to Russian commands, and much of its equipment comes from the Soviet Union, limiting the possibilities to function or develop outside of what the Soviets demand of it."
DDR_stasi_idea:0 "Stasi"
DDR_stasi_idea_desc:0 "The Stasi is a fact of life for every citizen of East Germany. The amount of info, agents, and informants this organization has under its control, and almost every citizen has a file.  Their most trusted friends and even family have ties to the Stasi, they just don't know it."
DDR_rigid_democratic_centralism_idea:0 "Rigid Democratic Centralism"
DDR_rigid_democratic_centralism_idea_desc:0 "The East German Government has not aged well.  the ministers are set on decisions made with almost no compromise to be made or attempted.  This has made it difficult to appoint promising ministers who have a better understanding of the domestic situation of East Germany. This will have to change if they want any chance of a more stable and efficient administration."

#### LEADER DESC ####
ERICH_HONECKER_DESC:0 "Erich Honecker was born on the 25th August, 1912 in Neunkirchen as the 4th child of a coal miner. After the First World War, Honecker was firsthand introduced to the horrors of Western Imperialism as he watched French troops occupy his home of the Saarland, which introduced him to the ideas of Communism. After his tenth birthday, Honecker became a member of the Spartacus League's children's group in Wiebelskirchen, and joined the Young Communist League of Germany. He rose through the ranks, and by 1928 he went to attend the International Lenin School in Moscow after being handpicked by the KJVD. After returning to Germany and working for the KPD, he was arrested by the Nazis in 1937 and sentenced to 10 years Brandenburg-Görden Prison. Following the liberation of the prison by Soviet forces, Honecker quickly rejoined politics under the Ulbricht Group and became a leading party member and took his place in the party's Central Committee. By 1971, Honecker was appointed First Secretary of the Central Committee. For the last 10 years, Honecker's leadership has been marked with a period of relative stability brought on by his policies of \"consumer socialism\" along with a liberalization of the arts. While new challenges face East Germany in the 80s, it is yet to be seen if Honecker can handle whatever the world will throw at him."
