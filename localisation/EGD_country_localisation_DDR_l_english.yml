#### IDEAS ####
DDR_jewel_of_the_warsaw_pact_idea:0 "Jewel of the Warsaw Pact"
DDR_jewel_of_the_warsaw_pact_idea_desc:0 "Of all the Socialist States of the Warsaw Pact, perhaps none is more dear to the Soviet Union than the German Democratic Republic. Boasting long term planning of the economy, a focus on consumer goods, and electronics manufacturing capabilities, as well as being the literal front line of the Communist Bloc, the DDR enjoys warm relations with the Soviets and lots of prestige within Communist circles."
DDR_berlin_wall_idea:0 "Berlin Wall"
DDR_berlin_wall_idea_desc:0 "While the West claims the DDR government as tyrannical for the construction of the wall, the §RAnti-Fascist Protection Rampart§! stands as as a bastion of socialism in the face of barbaric capitalism. In the past, the agents of capital were able to infiltrate the East German homeland, feeding information back to their CIA handlers and whispering lies in the ears of the workers, driving many to immigrate to the West.\n\nFear. No. Longer. For nearly 20 years, the wall has served as a force preventing western aggression and kept the workers safe in their homes."
DDR_soviet_military_dependence_idea:0 "Soviet Military Dependence"
DDR_soviet_military_dependence_idea_desc:0 "Although the National People's Army is theoretically an independent force, in practice it is still subordinated to the Soviet Military. East German forces are expected to listen to Russian commands, and much of its equipment comes from the Soviet Union, limiting the possibilities to function or develop outside of what the Soviets demand of it."
DDR_stasi_idea:0 "Stasi"
DDR_stasi_idea_desc:0 "The Stasi is a fact of life for every citizen of East Germany. The amount of info, agents, and informants this organization has under its control, and almost every citizen has a file.  Their most trusted friends and even family have ties to the Stasi, they just don’t know it."
DDR_rigid_democratic_centralism_idea:0 "Rigid Democratic Centralism"
DDR_rigid_democratic_centralism_idea_desc:0 "The East German Government has not aged well.  the ministers are set on decisions made with almost no compromise to be made or attempted.  This has made it difficult to appoint promising ministers who have a better understanding of the domestic situation of East Germany. This will have to change if they want any chance of a more stable and efficient administration."
