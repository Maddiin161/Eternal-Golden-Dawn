super.1.t:0 "End of the Iraq-Iran War"
super.1.d:0 "Iran announced today that the Iraqi government has formally signed an unconditional surrender in Baghdad. While Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein's whereabouts are still unknown, the upper leadership of the Ba'ath Party offered a full surrender of the Iraqi ground forces following an encircling of the major chokepoints of the country by the Iranian Army. The conflict, marked by chemical warfare, ethnic cleansing and human rights violations has come to an end with Tehran announcing the formalization of a transitionary government to remove the Ba'athists from power. Leaders of Iraq's Shi'a militias and political parties, including the influential Supreme Council for the Islamic Revolution in Iraq, have been selected as heading this transition. As these talks begin, Sunni and Ba'athist militias have conducted bombings and ambushes of Iranian forces as the country rests on the precipice of further violence. The future place of the Kurdish separatists, whose uneasy alliance with Tehran played a large role in their victory, is yet to decided."

super.2.t:0 "End of the Iraq-Iran War"
super.2.d:0 "Iraqi President Saddam Hussein announced in a press conference in Baghdad today that the Iranian government has signed a peace treaty following the death of the influential leader of the country, the Ayatollah Khomeini. Iraqi forces swept across Khuzestan, seizing vital oil fields and sending the already unstable, post-revolutionary country into chaos. The Islamic Jurist council was captured by the Iraqi army, as the Ba'ath Party announces talks with the People's Mujahedin of Iran as the new, secular ruling party of the country. The IRGC has announced its break from the former government of Tehran, stating that they will 'fight every invader until the last man,' solidifying their rejection of surrender. Kurdish, Azerbaijani and Baloch fighters have likewise committed to their national liberation projects against both Iran and the new Iraqi military government."

super.3.t:0 "Unknown Weather Phenomenon Engulfs the Gulf"
super.3.d:0 "Following the tactical nuclear strike against Baghdad, decried by the Soviet Union and Iran as a violation of UN nuclear guidelines, the Iraqi government has signed a full surrender. The upper leadership of the ruling Ba'ath Party was eliminated almost instantly, alongside much of the city. However, in the aftermath of the strike, a bizarre weather pattern has begun in the desert as winds in excess of 120 miles an hour (193 km/h) whip across the desert. Sand storms are common yet this storm has been described by meteorologists as one of the most unique and destructive in the region's history, reaching almost 3 miles (4.8 kilometers) into the sky. Reports from near the storm have described houses, vehicles and animals ripped apart by the speed of the sand. An Iraqi helicopter crashed outside the storms area from the wind speed. More to follow as this storm develops..."

super.4.d:0 "From the ashes of the student movement, and in the shadow of the atomic bombings of the 50s, the winds of change have swept through Japan in the form of AUM Shinri-kyo. The anti-American sentiment and the cultural blow of the bombing of Kyoto has left a hole filled now by the teachings of Master Asahara. The lies and denouncements by the career politicians, leaders of the zaibatsus and military figures in bed with Washington have only strengthened the resolve of its followers. The arrest of Master Asahara will be the undoing of them. Followers in high places get you far..."

super.5.t:0 "FOR GOD SO LOVED THE WORLD"
super.5.d:0 "THAT HE GAVE HIS ONE AND ONLY SON, THAT WHOEVER BELIEVES IN HIM SHALL NOT PERISH BUT HAVE ETERNAL LIFE. FOR GOD DID NOT SEND HIS SON INTO THE WORLD TO CONDEMN THE WORLD, BUT TO SAVE THE WORLD THROUGH HIM. WHOEVER BELIEVES IN HIM IS NOT CONDEMNED, BUT WHOEVER DOES NOT BELIEVE STANDS CONDEMNED ALREADY BECAUSE THEY HAVE NOT BELIEVED IN THE NAME OF GOD'S ONE AND ONLY SON. THIS IS THE VERDICT: LIGHT HAS COME INTO THE WORLD, BUT PEOPLE LOVED DARKNESS INSTEAD OF LIGHT BECAUSE THEIR DEEDS WERE EVIL. EVERYONE WHO DOES EVIL HATES THE LIGHT, AND WILL NOT COME INTO THE LIGHT FOR FEAR THAT THEIR DEEDS WILL BE EXPOSED. BUT WHOEVER LIVES BY THE TRUTH COMES INTO THE LIGHT, SO THAT IT MAY BE SEEN PLAINLY THAT WHAT THEY HAVE DONE HAS BEEN DONE IN THE SIGHT OF GOD."

super.6.t:0 "Greater Mongolian People's Republic Established"
super.6.d:0 "Following the collapse of the Soviet Union, and the nuclear meltdown in China, many of the former constituent republics have declared their independence from Moscow and Beijing. Among them are the republics of Altai, Buryatia, Tuva and the Chinese Autonomous Region of Inner Mongolia, all of whom have aligned with the Mongolian leadership. In a bid for autonomy against Chinese and Russia aggression, the five nations signed the Sükhbaatar Agreement, named after the Mongolian independence leader, unifying the new nations under the name of the Greater Mongolian People's Republic. As chaos engulfs much of Asia following the collapse of two of the largest powers, the GMPR seeks to act as a stabilizing force in the region. Maintaining the communist leadership with a new outlook of what Premier Tsedenbal describes as "Pan-Mongolian socialist system," the GMRP celebrated its creation with a parade in the capital of Ulaanbaatar."

super.7.t:0 "Nuclear Detonations Reported in the PRC"
super.7.d:0 "Following nearly two weeks of radio silence from Beijing after what neighboring countries registered as nuclear strikes, the military emergency government of the PRC has confirmed these reports. Nearly 6 months ago, following the sudden death of Chinese paramount leader Deng Xiaoping, the so-called 'Beijing Council' of the CPC-Transhumanist wing installed an experimental central planning Artificial Intelligence known as the \"Long March\" as the central authority in the country. A fault in the hardware sent the program prematurely detonating the entirety of China's nuclear arsenal in their silos. As much of the country now lies in ruins, and separatist groups strike to establish their independence, the PLA Emergency Council assures that order will be restored imminently."

super.8.t:0 "Civil War in South Africa"
super.8.d:0 "Following months of political and ethnic turmoil over the policy of apartheid in the Union of South Africa, the situation has finally reached a boiling point with the assassination of president F. W. de Klerk two weeks ago. The assassin is still yet unknown, but the South African Defense Force's crackdown on the militant ANC and AWB prompted a sharp increase in guerrilla activity. The straw to break the springbok's back was the declaration of martial law by the acting military government of P. W.Botha, prompting the armed wings of the ANC, SACP and AWB to seize vital infrastructure in the north of the country. All three acting groups have declared the Johannesburg regime illegitimate as guerrillas and security forces clash in the country. In the chaos, the Namibian national liberation organization SWAPO unilaterally declared the independence of the country against the UN mandate orders. For now, clouds have darkened over the 'rainbow nation.'"

super.10.t:0 "War in SFR Yugoslavia"
super.10.d:0 "Following the declaration of independence by both Slovenia and Yugoslavia, one thing is clear: the Balkans are once again divided. While the "Ten-Day War" between the Yugoslav People's Army and Slovenian secessionist forces has subsided for the most part, armed conflict and ethnic violence between Croatia and Yugoslavia has heightened to a state of war. While Belgrade attempts to salvage what is left of the former republic, ethnic clashes by paramilitary and official armed forces have increased by Serbs and Croats, with outside observers warning of possible ethnic cleansing and potential genocide. Europe and the world watches as the country descends into violence, with the future of Yugoslavia increasingly unclear."

super.11.t:0 "Economists Warn of Coming Recession"
super.11.d:0 "The effects of the 1979 energy crisis and the oil prices skyrocketing following the revolution in Iran, unemployment and inflation has increased ten-fold in the United States as the NYSE reports the worst opening day since the economic free fall of the early 1960s. Economists at Harvard University and Cambridge warn of a worldwide recession should this downward trend continue, as many still have yet to recover from the recessions of years past."

super.12.t:0 "Australia a New Regional Power?"
super.12.d:0 "Following the introduction of Indonesia as the latest full member of the Pacific Development Forum, scholars and policy experts on the region have been debating the possibility of Australia and its associate states as a new regional power. The joint ANZL-led PDF has grown over the decade and now stands at 17 members, representing one of the largest regional blocs in the world. Given trade statistics show nearly a quarter of global trade going through the islands of the South Pacific, the liberal predominance of the PDF and Australia have astounded scholars for its economic growth after the recession earlier in the decade. The question of whether the PDF will be able to hold steady against growing Japanese and Chinese interests in the region will be contested in the coming years, as both countries announce their trade ambitions with the influence that comes with it."
