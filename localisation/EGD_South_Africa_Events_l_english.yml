southafrica.20.d:0 "Following months of political and ethnic turmoil over the policy of apartheid in the Union of South Africa, the situation has finally reached a boiling point with the assassination of president F. W. de Klerk two weeks ago. The assassin is still yet unknown, but the South African Defense Force's crackdown on the militant ANC and AWB prompted a sharp increase in guerrilla activity. The straw to break the springbok's back was the declaration of martial law by the acting military government of P. W.Botha, prompting the armed wings of the ANC, SACP and AWB to seize vital infrastructure in the north of the country. All three acting groups have declared the Johannesburg regime illegitimate as guerrillas and security forces clash in the country. In the chaos, the Namibian national liberation organization SWAPO unilaterally declared the independence of the country against the UN mandate orders. For now, clouds have darkened over the 'rainbow nation.'"
