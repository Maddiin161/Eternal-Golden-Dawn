NWF_Battle_for_Newfoundland_idea:0 "Battle for Newfoundland"
NWF_Battle_for_Newfoundland_idea_desc:0 "Newfoundland finds itself in a crosshair. Three of them, actually; American, Canadian, and British. All three shooters noticed that Newfoundland is falling apart and saw an opportunity to seize it. With promises of economic aid and building up the much-needed infrastructure, they aim to get Newfoundlan's population to dump the politically dominant RGL-EUP and accept the rule of their overlord. The RGL-EUP does not, by any means, like that, but at the same, is totally defenseless against the goliaths."
NWF_RGL_EUP_Domination_idea:0 "RGL-EUP Domination"
NWF_RGL_EUP_Domination_idea_desc:0 "If Newfoundland is a human, then the RGL-EUP is its heart. It has ruled the country since 1948 and has held an absolute majority in the government ever since. RGL-EUP is a merger of two nationalist political parties that want to keep the country independent. In order to stay in power, the party has resorted to using autocratic methods, which are criticized by the people and foreign countries. At the moment, the people have a very negative opinion of the government, especially due to the dreadful condition of the economy. Should that fact spiral out of control, Newfoundland as an independent nation might see its demise."
NWF_Anti_Nationalist_Youth_idea:0 "Anti Nationalist Youth"
NWF_Anti_Nationalist_Youth_idea_desc:0 "It is an unfortunate fact for Newfoundland that as the older generation passes away, so does the desire for a sovereign nation. The young blood is frustrated by the economic state the country finds itself in and would simply prefer a stable economy to an autonomous country. This causes clashes between children and their parents, resulting in public anxiety and the economic condition of the nation does not help this a bit. The youngsters, therefore, aim for Newfoundland to join a confederation, while their parents want to continue the fight for an independent nation."
NWF_Cod_Supply_Shortages_idea:0 "Cod Supply Shortages"
NWF_Cod_Supply_Shortages_idea_desc:0 "Since time immemorial, Newfoundland's economy has been dependent on the cod fishing industry. With the need for additional income, sailors began using special equipment, such as electronic navigation systems, sonars, special radars, and much more. This boosts the economy, but it also causes the cod population to plummet. This phenomenon is called overfishing. Newfoundland has already seen the drastic effects of the low cod population and the horrific consequences it had on the economy and the environment, but an increasing amount of experts claim that something even more destructive is coming. Each day fishermen return to the ports with fewer and fewer fish than they caught yesterday. A crisis is on the way."
NWF_Lack_of_Infrastructure_idea:0 "Lack of Infrastructure"
NWF_Lack_of_Infrastructure_idea_desc:0 "Newfoundland roads have seen better days, or they would if they existed in the first place. Unfortunately, a lack of funding has kept any growth in infrastructure from occurring. Wasteful spending and investments in dead-end projects perpetuate this lack of money. The railway system stands as the only reliable form of transportation for goods and people. However, the railways' effectiveness is blunted by the general disrepair of roads and rail yards, which makes unloading from the trains a challenge. The only viable option is that Newfoundland can take is allowing foreign investments towards their infrastructure, which might influence more than just roads."
