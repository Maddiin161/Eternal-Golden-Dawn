#### IDEAS ####
GRE_democratic_experiment_idea:0 "Democratic Experiment"
GRE_democratic_experiment_idea_desc:0 "The Hellenic Republic, due to the unique way it joined the Communist Bloc, is an oddity - a multi-party state. Although the KKE is the dominant force in the country, the EDA and the PASOK are also legal and active, debates over the "correct" form of Socialism fill the streets, and elections are regularly held to renew the government. Foreign observers predict the situation cannot last forever, but yet somehow it continues to work nonetheless.
GRE_fresh_socialism_idea:0 "Fresh Socialism"
GRE_fresh_socialism_idea_desc:0 "There is no stronger force than the fervor of the recent convert, and the saying holds true in Greece. Partisans still walk the streets, posters and art still adorn public murals, and the people stand united in this brave new world. The People's Army are prepared to beat back any attempt at counter-revolution or outside threat, to allow the young Socialist state time to grow and blossom."
GRE_recovering_economy_idea:0 "Recovering Economy"
GRE_recovering_economy_idea_desc:0 "Although the actual fighting was brief, the damage the fighting did against the rule of the Colonels, and the ensuing economic crash as Greece was unceremoniously cut off from the West, resulted in the 70s becoming a time of economic hardship. Although the worst pangs of hunger and toil have passed, there is still a long way to go to get Greece back on track."
