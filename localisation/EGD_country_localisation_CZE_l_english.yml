CZE_dissident_movement_idea:0 "Dissident Movement"
CZE_dissident_movement_idea_desc:0 "Starting from 1977 with the appearance of Charter 77, a manifesto written by 243 people; among them were artists, former public officials, and other prominent figures. On a larger scale, independent activity is expressed through underground writing and publishing. Worringly enough, with a large amount of the student base joining the cause, the campaign against the party could have a chance to boil over to a full-blown anti-communist riot if reforms continue to be rejected."
CZE_legacy_of_prague_spring_idea:0 "Legacy of Prague Spring"
CZE_legacy_of_prague_spring_idea_desc:0 "After the Failed Prague Spring reforms put in place in by Alexander Dubcek in 68' and the military response from bloc armies that came quickly afterwards has soured the vision of the socialist experiment within Czechoslovakia. Growing contempt for the regime and bloc countries have been steadily rising and any support that western leftists had for the Soviet Union went up in smoke."
CZE_successful_federalization_idea:0 "Successful Federalization"
CZE_successful_federalization_idea_desc:0 "Wanting to avoid the issues of the second Czechoslovakian republic, the two republics have federated, allowing more political autonomy for the Slovakian national government. Moreover, the people of Czechoslovakia are not only citizens of the Czech Socialist Republic, but now hold equal citizenship in the Socialist Republic of Slovakia. This has brought down any tensions between the two national bodies within the country, allowing a straightforward approach to governance. The Republics Stand United!"

#### LEADER DESC ####

CZE_gustav_husak_desc:0 "Gustav Husak was born as a son of an unemployed worker in Pozsonyhidegkut, Austria-Hungary. He joined the Communist Youth Union at the age of sixteen while studying at the grammar school in Bratislava and in 33 he joined the Communist Party of Czechoslovakia (KSC). During World War II he was periodically imprisoned by the Jozef Tiso government for illegal Communist activities, and he was one of the leaders of he 1944 Slovak National Uprising against Nazi Germany and Tiso. After the war, he began a career as a government official in Slovakia and party functionary in Czechoslovakia. Husak's loyalty to the central organs of the Czechoslovak Communist party as well as his considerable talent for body politics and a ruthless approach to political opponents contributed largely to the crushing of the Democratic dissent in Slovakia and subjugating the popular opinion in the country to the prevailing political currents. In 1950, he fell victim to a Stalinist purge of the party leadership, and was sentenced to life imprisonment, spending the years from 1954 to 1960 in prison. As the Soviet Union grew increasingly alarmed by Dubcek's liberal reforms in 1968, , Husak, originally Dubcek's ally and a moderate supporter of the reform programme, began calling for caution. Supported by Moscow, he was appointed leader of the Communist Party of Slovakia in as early as August 1968, and he succeeded Dubcek as first secretary of the Communist Party of Czechoslovakia in April 1969. He reversed Dubcek's reforms and purged the party of its liberal members. In the first years following the invasion, Husak managed to appease the outraged civil population by providing decent living standards and avoiding any overt reprisals. Nearly two decades after the Prague spring, Husak is still one of Moscow's most loyal allies."
