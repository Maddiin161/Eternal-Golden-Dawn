PER_Ruhollah_Khomeini_desc:0 "Born on September 24, 1902, Ruhollah Mousavi whose given name means "inspired of God" was born into a family of Shi'ite religious scholars in the small Iranian village of Khomein. In 1903, just five months after Khomeini's birth, his father, was murdered.\nBoth Khomeinii and his brother were avid religious scholars like their forefathers, and both attained the status of Ayatollah, which is given only to Shi'ite scholars of the highest knowledge.\nAs a young boy, Khomeini was a great academic, Khomeini's older brother decided to send him to the city of Arak in 1920. There, Khomeini studied with the renowned Islamic scholar Yazdi Ha'iri. Ha'iri left Arak for the city of Qom in 1923, and Khomeini followed. He then committed all of his efforts to furthering his own religious studies.In the 1930s the leader of Iran, Reza Shah, weakened the powers of religious leaders and promoted a more secularized country, the most powerful religious figures in Iran remained silent and encouraged their followers to do the same.\nUnable to speak out against what he saw as a country leaving its Islamic roots and values behind, Khomeini turned his efforts toward teaching. He began to cultivate a group of dedicated pupils who became his staunchest supporters during his days as an Islamic revolutionary. On March 31, 1961, Ayatollah Boroujerdi died and Khomeini was in a position to take up the mantle left by the late religious leader. After publishing his writings on Islamic science and doctrines, many Shi'ite Iranians began to see Khomeini as Marja-e Taqlid (a person to be imitated).\nIn 1962, Khomeini began protesting the intentions of the Iranian government. The Shah continued to cultivate close ties with the United States, and to be what Khomeini considered "soft" on Israel. After delivering another inflammatory speech in the fall of 1964, Khomeini was arrested and deported to Turkey. Prevented by Turkish law from wearing the traditional clothes of a Shi'ite cleric and scholar, Khomeini took up residence in Najaf, Iraq in September 1965. He remained there for 13 years, until the revolution in 1979 which saw him rising in power and becoming Iran’s leader. With the The new Iranian government and the Carter Administration of the US in an ongoing standoff In view of the hostage crisis, Khomeini needs to address the issues hasty if he wants to see an era of progress for the young Islamic republic."

PER_hostage_crisis_category_desc:0 "\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBeginning in the fall of 1978, the U.S. embassy in Tehran had been the scene of frequent demonstrations by Iranians who opposed the American presence in the country, and on February 14, 1979, about a month after the shah had fled Iran, the embassy was attacked and briefly occupied. The embassy weathered this assault, during which several of its personnel were killed or wounded, but Iran was in the throes of enormous revolutionary change, which called for a new U.S. posture in Iran. Consequently, by the start of the hostage crisis, the embassy staff had been cut from more than 1,400 men and women before the revolution to about 70. In addition, attempts had been made to arrive at a modus vivendi with Iran’s provisional government, and during the spring and summer the Iranian authorities sought to strengthen security around the embassy complex.\n\n\nThe Current Tensions are:  [per_hostage_tensions_loc]\n\nThe Americans currently are: [per_hostage_american_willingness_loc]\n\nWe are: [per_hostage_iranian_willingness_loc] \n\nThe Balance of Power is currently: [per_hostage_balance_of_power_loc]\n\n§RIf tensions escalate too far, the consequences will be disasterous for both sides!§!"

#### EVENTS ####

iran.1.t:0 "The End of the Iranian Hostage Crisis"
iran.1.d:0 "After months of tense negotiations, the Iranian Hostage Crisis has finally ended. The international consensus agrees that the signing of the Algiers Accord is heavily in favor of the Americans after repeated concessions on the part of the Khomeini government, caused mainly by economic pressure imposed by the United States. As part of the Algiers Accord, the provisional government in Iran has agreed to release all 53 hostages without harm, as well as pay over 2.5 Billion USD in damages to American nationals who were affected by the hostage crisis. Yet, the failure of the Khomeini government to achieve their policy objectives, such as bringing back the Shah and his assets to Iran, getting their government officially recognized as legitimate, and failing to secure American promises of non-interference in Iranian affairs have cast significant doubt onto them. In America, the [Root.GetName] administration has achieved a massive popularity boost due to their deft diplomatic maneuvering in resolving the crisis."
iran.1.a:0 "A Blow to American Foreign Policy"
iran.2.d:0 "After months of tense negotiations, the Iranian Hostage Crisis has finally ended. It seems like a treaty which slightly favors the United States has been signed, although many in Iran are nevertheless satisfied with the Outcome.  As part of the Algiers Accord, the provisional government in Iran has agreed to release all 53 hostages without harm, as well as pay over 2.5 Billion USD in damages to American nationals who were affected by the hostage crisis.  While the Khomeini government has failed to achieve objectives such as bringing back the Shah and his assets to Iran, they have managed to obtain American pledges of non-interference in Iranian affairs, as well as official recognition for their government. With the crisis ending with a whimper, not a bang, the world breathes a sigh of relief as it appears that war and violence in the Middle East has been avoided for now.
