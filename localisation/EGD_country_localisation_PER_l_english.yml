PER_hostage_crisis_category:0 "American Hostage Crisis"
PER_hostage_crisis_category_desc:0 "\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBeginning in the fall of 1978, the U.S. embassy in Tehran had been the scene of frequent demonstrations by Iranians who opposed the American presence in the country, and on February 14, 1979, about a month after the shah had fled Iran, the embassy was attacked and briefly occupied. The embassy weathered this assault, during which several of its personnel were killed or wounded, but Iran was in the throes of enormous revolutionary change, which called for a new U.S. posture in Iran. Consequently, by the start of the hostage crisis, the embassy staff had been cut from more than 1,400 men and women before the revolution to about 70. In addition, attempts had been made to arrive at a modus vivendi with Iran’s provisional government, and during the spring and summer the Iranian authorities sought to strengthen security around the embassy complex.\n\n\nThe Current Tensions are:  [per_hostage_tensions_loc]\n\nThe Americans currently are: [per_hostage_american_willingness_loc]\n\nWe are: [per_hostage_iranian_willingness_loc] \n\nThe Balance of Power is currently: [per_hostage_balance_of_power_loc]\n\n§RIf tensions escalate too far, the consequences will be disasterous for both sides!§!"
