 IRQ_lion_of_babylon_roars_desc:0 "The British ruled Iraq, sucking out its resources and slaughtering its sons, but then the Ba’athists took a stand and freed Iraq, nationalising the banks and oil, modernising the nation at speeds that have never been seen before, and finally, truly bringing it into the 20th Century.\nAnd now with Saddam Hussein as the helmsmen, he and the Iraqi people dream of a nation that will stand above, and never be ravaged by the British, Syrians, Iranians, and even the Americans, ever again."
 IRQ_and_iraq_holds_its_breath_desc:0 "With the reign of Saddam Hussein just beginning, many wonder what the future holds, luckily for most, this future appears bright. The amazing progress of the economy, healthcare and education attracts people from all over the middle east who seek refuge from the violence that grips it. For many, the sacrifice of rights are worth the security of their children, and a future."
 IRQ_siege_of_najaf_desc:0 "The Shia of Iraq has long suffered under the Ba’athist regime. Once loyal members of the Ba’athists, they now find themselves systemically oppressed by the Sunni minority that makes up a majority of the government.\nThe protests caused by the oppression have quickly turned into riots following the Islamic revolution in Iran, and the Shias have begun to call for a man named al-Sadr, their “Iraqi Khomeni” to lead a revolution and turn Iraq into an Islamic Republic."
 IRQ_holding_the_arab_banner_desc:0 "Saddam Hussein is the last man holding the torn Pan-Arab banner in the middle east, and he will not let it fall, no matter how much blood he must wade through with it.\nHe has fought to defend this, through revolutions, and Pan-Arab struggles with Israel, even joining with enemies to participate. Pan-Arabs all across the middle east cheer for his crusade, and his enemies cry for his head. "
 IRQ_against_those_who_wish_to_harm_desc:0 "Israel, America, The Kurds, The Islamic Republics, they all gnash at Iraq and try to tear down the Pan-Arab flag that Hussein has so firmly planted. \nWe must strike first, harder, and swifter to ensure that they will not."
 IRQ_tying_the_loose_end_desc:0 "The Ba’athist Party is a varied one, with a varied history, unfortunately that means that there are many members who do not agree with Hussein’s vision of what the future of Iraq should be and push back against his will. This cannot be allowed, especially with the Syrian Branch and their evil plots to overthrow Saddam."
 IRQ_crushing_the_vipers_head_desc:0 "The Islamic Revolution in Iraq must be a stillborn one. Al-Sadyr has been growing more powerful by the day as important dissident figures pledge loyalty to him, and the whispers of a Islamic Revolution in Iraq turn into shouts.\nSecurity forces and the Mukharabat have been sent out to do the long overdue task of silencing Al-Sadyr and his sister, Amina. "
 IRQ_aflaq_and_his_word_desc:0 "Ever since the Ba’athist split, Syria has resisted our attempts to unify and will not accept our Ba’athist ideology, despite our best attempts. Hussein has authorised a propaganda campaign in Syria to use Aflaq’s own words to prove to them that their branch is illegitimate and that Iraqi Ba’athism is true. "

 ### IDEAS ###
 IRQ_cult_of_saddam_idea:0 "Cult of Saddam"
 IRQ_cult_of_saddam_idea_desc:0 "Saddam Hussein's rule over Iraq is absolute. In order to manipulate the Iraqi population into compliance, the engines of propaganda have been running non-stop since Hussein's ascendence. But there's a lid on how much people can be deceived and Saddam's propaganda apparatus is reaching that limit.\n\nTo remain in power, Saddam will match the anticipations he set on himself, like the man he is."
 IRQ_tensions_with_tehran_idea:0 "Tensions with Tehran"
 IRQ_tensions_with_tehran_idea_desc:0 "The tensions between Iraq and Iran have never been so disastrous. Iran's ambitions of becoming the vanguard of Shia Muslims have clearly been shown to us and to world, when the Iranian leadership became the supplier of arms to the Shia protests. That, combined with the decisive political and diplomatic differences of both countries, suggests that a conflict is inevitable."
 IRQ_banner_of_liberation_idea:0 "the Banner of Arab Liberation"
 IRQ_banner_of_liberation_idea_desc:0 "Nasser's vision to unify the Arab people has not yet come true. The effort of most nations in the Middle East to achieve pan-Arabism has been either abandoned or failed.\n\nYet, despite being surrounded by nations hostile to Nasser's dream, in Baghdad, the Nasserist banner still stands. Iraq marches forward with the flag of the Arab people!"
 IRQ_shining_jewel_idea:0 "Shining Jewel"
 IRQ_shining_jewel_idea_desc:0 "Amongst the severe poverty of the Middle East, Iraq's economy stands as a shining example for other Arab countries. Providing both good -and free- healthcare and education for its people, while also having one of the fastest-growing economies in the world with a staggering 1325% GDP increase in just ten years, it is no wonder that many people consider this to be the golden age of Iraq."
 IRQ_sadr_uprisings_idea:0 "Sadr Uprisings"
 IRQ_sadr_uprisings_idea_desc:0 "Since 1977, Iraq has been plagued by the Sadr uprisings. They were set off like a stick of dynamite, with the spark being the arrest of Ayatollah Muhammad Baqir al-Sadr. His powerful movement that opposed the Ba’athist rule has since only grown in size and so have the protests.\n\nEven after three years, Saddam's administration has been attempting to stamp out the fire of the protests, though unsuccessfully."
