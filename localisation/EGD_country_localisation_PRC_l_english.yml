PRC_lingering_effects_of_the_cultural_revolution_idea:0 "Lingering Effects of the Cultural Revolution"
PRC_lingering_effects_of_the_cultural_revolution_idea_desc:0 "With the death of chairman Mao in 1976 came the horrid realization of the serious consequences his "Cultural Revolution" had for the Chinese system as a whole. The Cultural Revolution, apart from the political instability, produced slower economic growth and a decline in the capacity of the government to deliver goods and services. Officials at all levels of the political system have learned that future shifts in policy would jeopardize those who had aggressively implemented previous policies, a situation which could be described as bureaucratic timidity."
PRC_power_struggle_deng_controlled_idea:0 "Power Struggle - Deng Dominant"
PRC_power_struggle_deng_controlled_idea_desc:0 "After the death of Chairman Mao and the subsequent purge of the anti-party Gang of Four, China's future has been largely a mystery. In the power vacuum that followed the Gang of Four's removal, two opposing factions emerged: The orthodox followers of Mao Zedong Thought led by Hua Guofeng, and the economically reformist faction led by Deng Xiaoping.\n\nDeng Xiaoping's reformists have made staggering progress in recent months, and have near-total control of state apparatus. Military officials, politicians, and bureaucrats across China recognize Deng as the sole leader of the country, and without serious pushback from Hua Guofeng, total reformist control over China seems near."
PRC_power_struggle_deng_leaning_idea:0 "Power Struggle - Deng Leaning"
PRC_power_struggle_deng_leaning_idea_desc:0 "After the death of Chairman Mao and the subsequent purge of the anti-party Gang of Four, China's future has been largely a mystery. In the power vacuum that followed the Gang of Four's removal, two opposing factions emerged: The orthodox followers of Mao Zedong Thought led by Hua Guofeng, and the economically reformist faction led by Deng Xiaoping.\n\nTaking advantage of Hua Guofeng's inability to enact solid, decisive policy, Deng Xiaoping has convinced many politicians and bureaucrats to support the reformist plans for economic and even some political development. However, Maoists continue to dissent from this opinion, viewing the proposed economic reforms as being borderline revisionist to Mao's original vision."
PRC_power_struggle_hua_leaning_idea:0 "Power Struggle - Hua Leaning"
PRC_power_struggle_hua_leaning_idea_desc:0 "After the death of Chairman Mao and the subsequent purge of the anti-party Gang of Four, China's future has been largely a mystery. In the power vacuum that followed the Gang of Four's removal, two opposing factions emerged: The orthodox followers of Mao Zedong Thought led by Hua Guofeng, and the economically reformist faction led by Deng Xiaoping.\n\nVowing to end the war in Vietnam, Hua Guofeng has managed to reassert himself off a wave of renewed public support, and his faction of orthodox Maoists has begun undoing many of Deng's unpopular wartime legislation. Despite this, reformist influence in government is still heavy, and resistance to Hua's anti-war sentiment is increasingly prevalent in many political circles."
PRC_power_struggle_hua_controlled_idea:0 "Power Struggle - Hua Dominant"
PRC_power_struggle_hua_controlled_idea_desc:0 "After the death of Chairman Mao and the subsequent purge of the anti-party Gang of Four, China's future has been largely a mystery. In the power vacuum that followed the Gang of Four's removal, two opposing factions emerged: The orthodox followers of Mao Zedong Thought led by Hua Guofeng, and the economically reformist faction led by Deng Xiaoping.\n\nHua Guofeng's Maoists' campaign to rid the party of claimed revisionists has gone remarkably well, with many politicians renouncing their formerly reformist viewpoints altogether. Along with overwhelming public support against Deng Xiaoping, Hua Guofeng has seemingly asserted himself as China's sole ruler, and without a serious reformist counter-offensive, it will seemingly stay this way."
PRC_vietnamese_stalemate_idea:0 "Vietnamese Stalemate"
PRC_vietnamese_stalemate_idea_desc:0 "The intervention in Vietnam, while expected to be a matter to be resolved in just a few weeks, has been draining a lot of the PLA's equipment and has absolutely devastated the morale of the Chinese troops. With the military turmoil on the front lines and the political one back in Beijing both worsening by the day, this detrimental for China conflict needs to be resolved immediately so that the worst can be prevented."
PRC_small_protests_idea:0 "Small Protests"
PRC_small_protests_idea_desc:0 "The Chinese government has reported unusual activity in the streets. A few individuals are showing up out of nowhere with placards and banners to openly disagree with the war between Vietnam and the People's republic of China. The groups are formed largely by young students who oppose the conflict. They hope to awaken the wider public and press the government to immediately halt all military actions on Vietnamese soil. However, the protests are extremely disorganized and the Chinese government should have no issue dispersing the rallies. If the Chinese politicians oversleep the little threat the demonstrations present, they might find themselves in a horrid situation."
PRC_medium_protests_idea:0 "Medium Protests"
PRC_medium_protests_idea_desc:0 "The situation in China is reportedly growing more alarming than it seemed. Contrarily to the politicians of the PRC, the demonstrators have not backed down; in fact, they are gaining momentum as each day passes. In the past days, the leaders of the demonstrations were able to regroup and reorganize the protests and are currently creating a base for their next actions. Now, the heads of the protests can openly call for the resignation of the government and demand an immediate end to the conflict on the streets.\n\nBut the Chinese leadership still has time and power to constrain the threat the protests pose, though it may be too late in a few moments."
PRC_large_protests_idea:0 "Large Portests"
PRC_large_protests_idea_desc:0 "It appears that the Chinese government has not replied to the protests in a manner that would satisfy the dissidents. Small groups of youngsters were able to mobilize entire cities into masses of people of all kinds who are not afraid to let the officials hear their opinion about the conflict in Vietnam. The protesters are engaging the police and security forces and hour by hour, their powers grow, while the strength and reputation of the Chinese state fade away."
PRC_crippling_protests_idea:0 "Crippling Protests"
PRC_crippling_protests_idea_desc:0 "The situation in China has, by all accounts, spiraled into total chaos. Entire boulevards are marching under banners with an obvious signal; to stop the war. Rumors have it that police stations in metropolises were given orders to violently disperse the crowds, but they all defected to the protestor's side and, officially, among many other public service members and politicians, denounced the policy of the PRC. The streets lay in disarray and attempts to contain the protest have all failed. The whole world watches the Chinese regime crumble on itself. With no clear way out of this mess, it is clear that change must come quickly."
