cuba.20.t:0 "Communist Party of Cuba - Espectro de Guevara Elected"
cuba.20.d:0 "An uncharacteristically cold wind is blowing through Havana. The radical youth that make up the "Espectro de Guevara" wing of the Communist Party of Cuba have secured a majority in the National Assembly of People's Power and have begun to agitate the party in a far more expansionist direction, inspired by the actions of the Sendero Luminoso in Peru. Despite their youthful makeup, the sect of the CPC is led by the firebrand Camilo Cienfuegos, a man thought dead for half a decade following the Revolution, only to have miraculously survived his plane crash. Wholesale rejecting the Soviet and Chinese revisionism, Cuba now turns their eyes to the wars of national liberation in Angola and India. To the north, however, the watchful eyes of the American eagle once again turn to the island off the coast of Florida."
