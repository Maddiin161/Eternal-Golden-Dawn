KUW_the_golden_age_idea:0 "The Golden Age"
KUW_the_golden_age_idea_desc:0 "The years between the end of World War 2 and today are referred to as the Golden Age in Kuwait. With the country's economy flourishing non-stop due to the fact that it still is one of the biggest oil exporters in the region, and with its citizens enjoying modern and high living standards as well as more individual freedoms in comparison to other countries in the Middle East, it is no doubt that this situation will go on in the years to come."
KUW_Boursa_Kuwait_and_Souk_al-Manakh_idea:0 "Boursa Kuwait and Souk al-Manakh"
KUW_Boursa_Kuwait_and_Souk_al-Manakh_idea_desc:0 "Kuwait's two major stock exchanges, Al Manakh and Boursa, both of immense global importance, are currently fiercely competing for state legitimacy and dominance in the Kuwaiti economy. To gain an edge over the other, the two markets must earn the trust of investors and companies while simultaneously keeping their rivalry healthy in order to avoid a market crisis."
KUW_bald_eagle_far_from_home_idea:0 "Bald Eagle, Far from Home"
KUW_bald_eagle_far_from_home_idea_desc:0 "Despite the huge amounts of development that have been made in all aspects, Kuwait is viewed as a collaborationist nation by its fellow Arab countries. The fact that Kuwait assisted the West during the oil crisis along with the country being used by NATO and the Americans as a military base and a base of operations in the wider region has made it a laughingstock, and a potential military target, by the neighboring nations of Iran and Soviet aligned Syria."
