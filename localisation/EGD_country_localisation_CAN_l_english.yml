CAN_last_days_of_trudeaumania_idea:0 "Last Days of Trudeaumania"
CAN_last_days_of_trudeaumania_idea_desc:0 "Trudeau has held the position of Prime Minister of Canada for well over a decade, but recently it’s become increasingly obvious that his reign is coming to a close, winning the 1979 election by the smallest of margins and rapidly losing support, the Liberal party prepares for the absence of Trudeau. In Quebec, Rene Levesque readies the independence referendum that he has kept waiting for Trudeau’s retirement, considering him too great a rival. And the Progressive Conservative Party builds their ‘Grand Conservative Coalition’ and waits to strike to take the position of Prime Minister from the Liberals. If the transition from Trudeau to whoever comes next is mishandled, perhaps the last days of Trudeau may also be the last days of Canada. "
CAN_quebecois_nationalism_idea:0 "Quebecois Nationalism"
CAN_quebecois_nationalism_idea_desc:0 "The ‘Quebec Question’ has long weighed on Canadian politics, but ever since Trudeau took office he has managed to put it off, but only that, he hasn’t managed to answer it, and the people are beginning to ask. Currently, Quebecois nationalism coalesces around the premier of Quebec, Levesque, but independence is more than a simple ‘yes’ or ‘no’ Levesque plans for a liberal independent Quebec, but other factions such a Union Nationale desire fascism in free Quebec, or the Felquistes who will fight for a socialist Quebec. Whatever the ideology may be, they all desire independence, and Canada will need to reckon with that."
CAN_western_alienation_idea:0 "Western Alienation"
CAN_western_alienation_idea_desc:0 "Trudeau is known as the father of western alienation, and because of this the Liberal party has gained an increasing amount of animosity in the west, most voters either voting Progressive Conservative or NDP, but the problem of alienation doesn’t fall entirely on the Liberals. The Progressive Conservatives have been attempting to court Quebec rather than the west, so the west has felt that both major parties have turned their back on them, spurring discussions of forming a ‘western interests’ party if they continue to be ignored."
CAN_canadian_dissilussionment_idea:0 "Canadian Disillusionment"
CAN_canadian_dissilussionment_idea_desc:0 "Trudeau has always pushed against the grain, writing articles against the Korean war, being friends with Castro, Recognizing China and barring Taiwan from the Olympics, and being critical of the Cold War. And thus, under his long leadership, Canada has become critical of the Cold War as well, Oftentimes acting as a mediator between NATO and the Warsaw Pact, criticising the United States, pulling troops out of countries and refusing to join wars, and generally slowly distancing itself from the core NATO countries. This has created a growing divide between it, the United States and the United Kingdom as well as being the NATO state of choice for Communist nations to appeal to. "
CAN_constitutional_hope_idea:0 "Constitutional Hope"
CAN_constitutional_hope_idea_desc:0 "It would be safe to say that Canada is not in the most stable position currently, with high unemployment, and high inflation, nationalism and alienation, but as the 80s begin, Trudeau reveals his last hurrah, a Constitution. While many Canadians eagerly wait as they are cut from the strings of the UK and given their own bill of rights, one that may solve the issues plaguing the country. The process of creating the Constitution has proven to be a balancing act, Shouting matches between premiers during conferences, ignored phone calls, premiers revoking support when it is changed to appeal to others. Many are still excited and hopeful, but this may turn to despair, or worse, a fumbled constitution may spell the end of Canada."
