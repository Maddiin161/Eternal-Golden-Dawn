unitedstates.1.t:0 "Ronald Reagan Elected as President of the United States"
unitedstates.1.d:0 "Most major news networks and polling announcements have come to the same conclusion. Ronald Reagan, former actor turned Governor of California, will be the next President of the United States.\n\nTo his fans, Reagan heralds to a new Sunrise for America. A dedicated Conservative and Anti-Communist, Reagan has expressed support for anti-Communist forces in Central America and for the Philippine Government. He also rejects détente, and advocates a tougher stance against the Soviet Union.\n\nTo his opponents, he represents a dangerous demagogue, one who risks economic collapse with short sighted policy and risks bathing the world in nuclear hellfire with his belligerence. But tonight, is a night of celebration across America for the new world being heralded in."
unitedstates.1.a:0 "Congratulations, Mr. President."

unitedstates.2.t:0 "Jimmy Carter Reelected as President of the United States"
unitedstates.2.d:0 "The polls are in, and Jimmy Carter has won re-election for another four years. The opposition has delivered in their concession phone call, and Carter will address the public shortly. Carter, who came into office riding the tide of an economic boon and as a rejection of the chaos and corruption of the 60s, is expected to stay the course in his next term as President. However, questions remain as to how well he will navigate the new crisis' developing in South West Asia, from Afghanistan to Iran and India.\n\nBut most of the world breathes a sigh of relief at his re-election. Mr. Carter has stood for a stable United States and a diplomatic outlook, two things in short supply as the 80s begin. With luck, he can provide a pillar to help balance the chaos enveloping elsewhere."
unitedstates.2.a:0 "Four more years!"

unitedstates.3.t:0 "Edward Kennedy Reelected as President of the United States"
unitedstates.3.d:0 "After a tense election, the results have come in. The Democrats will retain the Presidency – but not the President. A grueling primary challenge led to Jimmy Carter, who many worried as susceptible to challenge by the Republican Party, to be replaced with Edward Kennedy.\n\nThe younger brother of the late President John Kennedy and the late Robert Kennedy, ‘Ted' won the election on a liberal platform including Healthcare reform. He has also been a strong critic of the Carter administration's handlings of multiple issues, including the Iranian Hostage crisis and the Naxalite Uprising.\n\nHowever, rumors swirl of affairs, cover-ups, and scandal surround the new President, especially involving an incident at Chappaquiddick that left a young woman dead. Despite this, many are happy to have a Kennedy in the White House once again, and the celebrations continue into the night."
unitedstates.3.a:0 "Camelot Returns!"

unitedstates.4.t:0 "George Bush Elected as President of the United States"
unitedstates.4.d:0 "Conservatives and American Allies across the world breathe a sigh of relief as George Bush is announced the next President of the United States. A man with a wealth of experience in foreign policy from his time as head of the CIA, many abroad go to sleep thankful that the next President has their interests at heart.\n\nDespite this, the new President still faces opposition. Many see him as uninterested in Domestic politics, and hardcore Conservatives who preferred Ronald Reagan are angry with his denunciations of 'Voodoo economics' and his apparent disinterest with the cuts to spending they see as necessary.\n\nRegardless of the future, one thing is for sure."
unitedstates.4.a:0 "A new era dawns."

unitedstates.21.t:0 "Ronald Reagan Assassinated"
unitedstates.21.d:0 "A nation in mourning, a nation in tears. Every newspaper, every television network, every bulletin, all with the same headlines. The President of the United states is shot dead, felled by an assassin's bullet after a routine visit to the Hilton Hotel in Washington. He is the first to be assassinated since John F Kennedy in 1963.\n\nNot much is known about the shooter yet, John Hinckley, but rumors swirl of a Communist plot. Newly inaugurated President Bush has spoken to the nation already, promising swift justice against anyone who participated in the plot. But now there is not much to do but wait.\n\nAlready, the Soviet Union has made the surprising step to put out a statement that they will cooperate with the Americans. What this will turn up remains to be seen."
unitedstates.21.a:0 "An awful day."
