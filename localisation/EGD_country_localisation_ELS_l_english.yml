jose_napoleon_duarte_desc:0 "Although an engineer by trade, Napoleón Duarte is primarily known for something different - being the man who brought true democracy to El Salvador.\nHaving been elected president first in 1977, Duarte was already known as a pro-democracy activist. He first came to prominence during the 1944 protests, getting shot by the forces of the totalitarian dictator Maximiliano Hernández Martínez. Forced to leave the country when Hernández dispersed the protesters, Duarte took refuge in the US and received a degree from the prestigious University of Notre Dame in Indiana. After Hernández got deposed in a coup in 1952, Duarte returned, helping the coup leader and new president Osmín Aguirre y Salinas in establishing the Second Republic. He played a crucial role in establishing the Christian Democratic Party (PDC), a centrist party modelled after the Mexican PRI as a moderate force against both the far left and the far right, and helped Aguirre y Salinas win proper presidential elections in 1957 and 1962.\nAs the constitution of the Second Republic allowed only one reelection to the president, Duarte's role increased further after he became the Minister of Foreign Affairs for Aguirre y Salinas' successor, Álvaro Magaña Borja, in 1967. Unlike the cold, technocratic Magaña, Duarte's affable personality endeared him to the public. While Magaña, a very competent economist, brought prosperity to El Salvador, it was Duarte who interacted with the people and who became face of this new, more democratic El Salvador.\nFinally ascending to the presidency in 1977, Duarte's term is most symbolised by further liberalising reforms. Unlike the relatively autocratic and caudillo-like Aguirre y Salinas and the cold and pragmatic Magaña, Duarte does try to let the voice of the people be heard as much as possible. However, this comes with its own baggage of problems - with the opposition rising, the far-right ARENA and the far-left FMLN are now threatening to rob PDC of its majority. It is now up to Duarte to give the PDC an ideological makeover and ensure he can win reelection in 1982, showing that El Salvador has no need for autocracy to keep extremists out of power." 
cayetano_carpio_salvador_desc:0 "Also known as "Comandante Marcio", Salvador Cayetano Carpio was born in 1918 in Santa Tecla to a poor family. After working as a baker for most of his childhood, Carpio decided to bring change to El Salvador, to allow others to escape similar fate. Thus, the "Ho Chi Minh of Latin America" was born.\nAfter spending over 30 years underground or in prison, Carpio became the undisputed leader of the Salvadoran left. Inspired by the great revolutionary Farabundo Martí, he led the Communist Party of El Salvador through their hardest times, ensuring they survival by motivating his comrades and recruiting greatly from the poorer regions. Thanks to his often brutal terror tactics against the government, Carpio gained reputation as a hard man who cannot be negotiated with - in spite of that, once Aguirre y Salinas dictatorship passed and subsequent presidents started democratisation of El Salvador, Carpio was forced by his moderate comrades into agreeing on a peace deal with the government, transforming the Communist Party of El Salvador into a legal party in 1975. Only a year later, PCS joined other leftist groups, creating the Farabundo Martí National Liberation Front, which has quickly become the primary opposition to the PDC.\nCarpio wasn't exactly fond of leading the revolution in the system of bourgeois "democracy", but some superficial moderation of course did serve its purpose. Now the FMLN managed to become the largest party, and no one can question its legitimacy. El Salvador now can finally be purged of the stench of reactionarism and embrace its future as a communist nation. Finally, the enemies of the working can be brought to justice. No one escapes revolution!"
roberto_daubuisson_salvador_desc:0 "The early life of Roberto D'Aubuisson Arrieta is remarkable in how unremarkable it was. Born to a family of French descent, D'Aubuisson used the relative well-being of his family to enrol into the military academy, inspired by the former president Maximiliano Hernández Martínez, graduating as an average student. He continued to serve in the army while growing his qualifications, ultimately even receiving training at the (in)famous School of the Americas in 1972, becoming a qualified communications officer.\nHowever, in El Salvador proper, D'Aubuisson was busy with other affairs than formal military service. In 1966, as Aguirre y Salinas prepared for handing over power to his more moderate successors, D'Aubuisson was among the people selected to operate the ANESAL, National Security Agency of El Salvador. Led by the brutal general Carlos Humberto Romero, its members worked completely in secrecy, often creating vigilante groups to enforce "justice" where the law failed to reflect needs of the regime. D'Aubuisson remained a loyal ANESAL member, slowly watching the organisation lose power as the regime moderated its course, until 1977, when the newly elected president Duarte dissolved the organisation.\nDisgusted with the weakness of the rulind PDC, D'Aubuisson created his own Nationalist Republican Alliance (ARENA), while also leading his own death squad, the feared Unión Guerrera Blanca (White Warrior's Union, UGB), becoming implicated in a great number of terror attacks. In spite of that, D'Aubuisson's message resonated with certain elements of Salvadoran society, and ARENA quickly became the largest right-wing opposition to the PDC.\nWith its victory, D'Aubuisson is now free to purge El Salvador of the stains of Marxism. Jewish conspirators might have conquered half of Europe, but as long as D'Aubuisson is here, not a single Judeo-Bolshevik is getting El Salvador. D'Aubuisson will kill every trade unionist, priest and activist he has to. El Salvador will be liberated, whether it wants it or not!"
