jose_napoleon_duarte_desc:0 "Although an engineer by trade, Napoleón Duarte is primarily known for something different - being the man who brought true democracy to El Salvador.\nHaving been elected president first in 1977, Duarte was already known as a pro-democracy activist. He first came to prominence during the 1944 protests, getting shot by the forces of the totalitarian dictator Maximiliano Hernández Martínez. Forced to leave the country when Hernández dispersed the protesters, Duarte took refuge in the US and received a degree from the prestigious University of Notre Dame in Indiana. After Hernández got deposed in a coup in 1952, Duarte returned, helping the coup leader and new president Osmín Aguirre y Salinas in establishing the Second Republic. He played a crucial role in establishing the Christian Democratic Party (PCD), a centrist party modelled after the Mexican PRI as a moderate force against both the far left and the far right, and helped Aguirre y Salinas win proper presidential elections in 1957 and 1962.\nAs the constitution of the Second Republic allowed only one reelection to the president, Duarte's role increased further after he became the Minister of Foreign Affairs for Aguirre y Salinas' successor, Álvaro Magaña Borja, in 1967. Unlike the cold, technocratic Magaña, Duarte's affable personality endeared him to the public. While Magaña, a very competent economist, brought prosperity to El Salvador, it was Duarte who interacted with the people and who became face of this new, more democratic El Salvador.\nFinally ascending to the presidency in 1977, Duarte's term is most symbolised by further liberalising reforms. Unlike the relatively autocratic and caudillo-like Aguirre y Salinas and the cold and pragmatic Magaña, Duarte does try to let the voice of the people be heard as much as possible. However, this comes with its own baggage of problems - with the opposition rising, the far-right ARENA and the far-left FMLN are now threatening to rob PDC of its majority. It is now up to Duarte to give the PDC an ideological makeover and ensure he can win reelection in 1982, showing that El Salvador has no need for autocracy to keep extremists out of power."
