#### IDEAS ####
HUN_new_economic_mechanism_idea:0 "New Economic Mechanism"
HUN_new_economic_mechanism_idea_desc:0 "In light of the Hungarian revolution in 56', the economic reforms have allowed enterprises the freedom to adjust prices and production to fit market conditions. In addition, rights have been given to buyers allowing them to choose between domestic goods and imported. Foreign trade has also allowed western goods to flow within Hungary. However, problems of mounting foreign debt, combiend with subsidization of unprofitable industries has led to economic slowdown and inefficency. The NEM has been critized for being ineffective due to Hungarian factories churning out low-quality goods that are unsellable on the global market."
HUN_limited_political_liberalization_idea:0 "Limited Political Liberalization"
HUN_limited_political_liberalization_idea_desc:0 "With a focus on the worker's well-being, Goulash Communism aims to establish a \"soft-dictatorship\" that seeks to improve the living conditions for the average citizen. These improvements have been achieved with more cultural, regulated economic freedoms and the relaxation of ideological pressure. Furthermore, the economy has also been reorganized to satisfy consumer demand better and establish beneficial economic relations with the west."

#### LEADER DESC ####
HUN_Kadar_desc:0 "Born a bastard son of a soldier and a maid, Kadar worked his way up from a rural and relatively poor upbringing to the leader of a nation, his story seemingly the dream of the working classes. He joined with the Communists by the late 20s, was involved with activism throughout the 30s, and when the Hungarian People's Republic was established, he joined the government then too. After the disastrous fallout of the Hungarian Revolution, Kadar became the voice of a middle ground in the Communist Party. Hungary would not return to the Stalinist brutality of the Rakosi era, nor would it try to expel the Soviets like Nagy. Instead, his policies would become known as Goulash Communism, after a tasty stew. And like even the tastiest of stews, one can only partake for so long. Kadar has been in power since the 1950s, and has become older, regretful, and tired. The Soviets, ever distrustful over his relative independence in domestic policy, keep a close eye on him. The people yearn for more change, and he might no longer be able to offer them what they desire. But Kadar didn't climb his way to the top only to roll over. Hungary has come far from 1956. And if Kadar has a say, it has far yet to go."
