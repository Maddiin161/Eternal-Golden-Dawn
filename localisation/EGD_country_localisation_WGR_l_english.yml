WGR_eternal_autumn_idea:0 "Ewiger Deutscher Herbst"
WGR_eternal_autumn_idea_desc:0 "The West German state is in the midst of its greatest political crisis since World War II.\n\nWhat at first seemed like a small footnote in German history, a series of hopeless and senseless terrorist attacks against American bases and members of the German government, became an unmistakable revelation of the failures of the government and the German state in general.\n\nThe crisis began on September 5, 1977, when the RAF kidnapped Hanns-Martin Schleyer, president of the Confederation of German Employers' Associations, to force the government to release several of its imprisoned members. The government refused to negotiate with the terrorists, leading to Schleyer's execution and the bombing of the Federal Court.While the state is desperately trying to avert the terrorist threat, emergency law after emergency law is enacted and the 'transparent citizen' is created, the danger does not even seem to be averted in the slightest, with almost already rhythmic attacks that seem to have already become commonplace."
WGR_strauss_shadow_idea:0 "Shadow of Strauß"
WGR_strauss_shadow_idea_desc:0 "Franz Josef Strauß - although his time as chancellor was several years ago, his influence can be found everywhere in German society, everywhere in the political order. Whether it's the emergency laws or the omnipresent Springer publishing house, the average German citizen can hardly escape Strauß, and with the escalating German autumn under Brazel, there are more and more citizens who want the provocative Strauß back."
