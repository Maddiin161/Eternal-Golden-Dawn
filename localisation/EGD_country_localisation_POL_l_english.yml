#### IDEAS ####
POL_catholic_resistance_idea:0 "Catholic Resistance"
POL_catholic_resistance_idea_desc:0 "Poland has been traditionally a bastion of Roman Catholicism in Eastern Europe, and the Church plays an outsized role in society. Recently, this has become a greater and greater threat to the Socialist Movement, as Priests and even the Pope has visited his homeland to appeal to the masses to resist Communist rule. This stubbornness will only persist so long as the masses are attached to the opium of religion."
POL_memories_of_the_gierek_decade_idea:0 "Memories of the Gierek Decade"
POL_memories_of_the_gierek_decade_idea_desc:0 "The limited liberalization of the 1970s has made way to a crisis in the present. The people, now that they've had a taste of freedom, demand more and more of it, while the economic reforms were sabotaged by the oil crisis and the ensuing inflation. Now only memories remain of what could have been, poisoning the minds of the people and wrecking the efficiency of the economy."
POL_harsh_repression_idea:0 "Harsh Repression"
POL_harsh_repression_idea_desc:0 "Hard choices must be made to ensure the stability of the revolution, and none so hard as the choice to maintain a security apparatus robust enough to suppress the chorus of dissent rising from the people. Money must be further drained from the budget to account for this expenditure, and both the army and state security must play their part in ensuring the peace, regardless of the cost."
