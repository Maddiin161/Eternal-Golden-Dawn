yugoslavia.1e.t:0 "Brotherhood and Unity"
yugoslavia.1e.d:0 "The new decade finds Yugoslavia in worse shape than it ever has been. With Tito’s health deteriorating, the dilemma of his successor becomes more pressing.Tito's right hand man, power hungry Alexandar Rankovic, is waiting for things to develop gradually while also preparing to assume the role of Yugoslavia's next president for life. In terms of the economy, the Market Socialist model may have served Yugoslavia well up until some years ago but now is a time of economic recession. Moreover, ethnic tensions and nationalism have been on the rise for quite some time now, with one of the largest demonstrations in Yugoslavia,Maspok or the “Croatian Spring” ,as foreign news agencies called it,taking place in the Socialist Republic of Croatia 10 years ago still being a hot topic."
yugoslavia.2e.t:0 "Great Expectations"
yugoslavia.2e.d:0 "Aleksandar Rankovic was always a power hungry man. From his days in the resistance until now he was always looking for opportunities and never did he hesitate to grab them. His presence in Yugoslav politics has been showing more in the last 2 decades, as in 1968 he was the biggest proponent of anti-economic reform. He eventually became Tito’s closest partner and now that his health is gradually worsening he is waiting to grab what he considers is rightfully his."
yugoslavia.3e.t:0 "Death of Tito"
yugoslavia.3e.d:0 "Comrade Tito has died.On the day of May 4th, 1980 at 15:05 in Ljubljana, the great heart of the President of our Socialist Yugoslavia, the President of the Presidency of Yugoslavia, the President of the League of Communists of Yugoslavia, Marshal of Yugoslavia, and the Commander-in-chief of the Yugoslav armed forces, Josip Broz Tito has stopped beating.Great sorrow and pain is shaking up the working class, nations and nationalities of our country, our every citizen, worker, soldier, war veteran, farmer, intellectual, every creator, pioneer and youth, and every girl and mother.For all his entire life. Tito was a fighter for the interests and goals of the working class, for the most humane ideals, and desires of our nations and nationalities. Tito is our dearest friend and he shall always be remembered."
yugoslavia.4e.t:0 "Lofty Aspirations"
yugoslavia.4e.d:0 "Not even a month has passed since Tito died and already the vultures have gathered to feast upon his body. Rankovic demands the leadership passed to him. Clearly a man like him should not have been allowed to gain so much power. “Tito specifically requested in the letters i present you,that i succeed him in power”, that was his announcement at the assembly of the presidency, and he refused to elaborate."
yugoslavia.5e.t:0 "Reckoning Without the Host"
yugoslavia.5e.d:0 "“But sir, the constitution clearly calls for the presidency to maintain leadership after Marshall's death…” The assembly's president responded reluctantly. "We can't just make a decision on our own." “Nonsense!” Rankovic yelled. For a brief while, the audience became silent. They couldn't prove Tito didn't write those letters, so perhaps the lunatic was correct. Guards led everyone outside, where a mob was already forming to oppose Rankovic. One thing is certain: the next few days will be critical for Yugoslavia's destiny."
yugoslavia.6e.t:0 "A Critical Choice"
yugoslavia.6e.d:0 "Second day of non-stop protests in Belgrade. News agencies from all over Europe are reporting on the situation ”President Alexandar Rankovic has suspended today’s presidium assembly, as opposition, workers, common people are gathering here outside the Yugoslav Parliament for a second day in a row. Rankovic has a decision to make, he needs to resign or push his people to the limits.” Rankovic turned the television off and sat on his chair.He peeked at his pistol inside his office’s drawer,sipped some of his whiskey without even bothering getting a glass and, thought…"

##### IDEAS ####
YUG_head_of_the_non_aligned_world_idea:0 "Head of the Non Aligned World"
YUG_head_of_the_non_aligned_world_idea_desc:0 "One of the features of superpower diplomacy, which the world was thrown into with the beginning of the Cold war, is dividing the world into large spheres of influence in which one superpower has power over the other, and into non-aligned sectors.Despite being a socialist country, Yugoslavia decided to be in neither the Soviet nor American power block. Together with many nations, Yugoslavia formed the Non-Aligned Movement, putting Tito as the leader. There, governments try to balance the ever-growing bi-polarization of the world."
YUG_remembering_maspok_idea:0 "Remembering Maspok"
YUG_remembering_maspok_idea_desc:0 "Ethnic tensions and nationalism have been on the rise for quite some time now, with one of the largest demonstrations in Yugoslavia,Maspok or the Croatian Spring as foreign news agencies called it, taking place in the Socialist Republic of Croatia 10 years ago still being a hot topic."
YUG_errors_of_market_socialism_idea:0 "Errors of Market Socialism"
YUG_errors_of_market_socialism_idea_desc:0 "In terms of the economy, the Market Socialist model may have served Yugoslavia well up until some years ago but now is a time of economic recession, as the state and few private companies haven't been doing as well in the global market, further damaging the annual income."
YUG_pearl_of_the_adriatic_idea:0 "Pearl of the Adriatic"
YUG_pearl_of_the_adriatic_idea_desc:0 "While the Yugoslav economy might be lacking in some areas, where it shines is its tourism. Thousands of people from all across Europe travel many miles just to reach the beautiful rocky beaches of the Adriatic sea. Upon their arrival, they are more than happy to spend their money there, which brings enormous revenue to the government's pocket. Despite being immensely lucrative, the tourism economy moves in cycles, as most tourists arrive in Summer. Building the entire economy around such an unreliable source of income might not be the wisest thing to do, especially in such turbulent times."

#### LEADER DESC #### 
EGD_RANKO_BIO:0 "Rankovic was born in the village of Drazevac near Obrenovac in the Kingdom of Serbia. Born into a poor family, Rankovic lost his father at a young age. He attended primary school in his hometown. He went to Belgrade to seek work and joined the workers' movement. Furthermore, he was also influenced by his colleagues who, at the time when the Communist Party was banned, brought communist literature with them, which Rankovic used to read. At age 15 he joined the union. In 1927 he met his future wife Anda, and a year later he joined the Communist Party of Yugoslavia. Soon he was named Secretary-General of the League of Communists of Youth of Yugoslavia in Belgrade. After becoming a member of the then-illegal Communist Party in 1928, he was sentenced to 6 years in prison. During his incarceration in Sremska Mitrovica and Lepoglava, he remained active in promoting Marxism and Leninism to younger prisoners, and fought to improve the living conditions for political prisoners. After his release from prison, he met Anda Jovanovic again and the two were married shortly thereafter. After completing his compulsory military service, the pair moved to Belgrade in January of 1937. While working as a member of the League of Communists of Serbia during this time, he was promoted to secretary by Tito, a role which he held until 1941.After the war ended, Rankovic gained a huge amount of power becoming Tito's main associate and right-hand man. A man with great ambitions, he now aims to further centralize Yugoslavia."
EGD_JNA_BIO:0 "The JNA Military Council is an emergency cabinet made up of the top senior leaders in the People's Army. The council of 11 members functions in a democratic way with frequent meetings where decisions are made through a voting process, and is deemed necessary in extreme emergency situations like Martial Law. The council, founded and maintained on military and socialist principles, works in close collaboration with the Armed Forces and is always ready to defend the socialist homeland and safeguard the Yugoslav people’s unity."
EGD_PRESIDIUM_BIO:0 "The Presidency of the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia is a collective head of state of the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia. It was established in 1971 according to amendments to the 1963 Constitution and reorganized by the 1974 Constitution. Up to 1974, the Presidency had 23 members – three from each republic, two from each autonomous province and President Josip Broz Tito.In 1974 the Presidency was reduced to 9 members – one from each republic and autonomous province and, until 1988, President of the League of Communists of Yugoslavia ex officio. Tito, as a president of the republic, was ex officio chairman of the Presidency. After his death -according to the constitution-  a new chairman of the Presidency is to be elected every year. The order of rotating of the members on the leading position is agreed in advance, so this annual election is a pure formality."
