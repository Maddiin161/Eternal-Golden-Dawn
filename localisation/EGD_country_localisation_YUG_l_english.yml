egd_yugoslavia.1.t:0 "Brotherhood and Unity"
egd_yugoslavia.1.d:0 "The new decade finds Yugoslavia in worse shape than it ever has been. With Tito’s health deteriorating, the dilemma of his successor becomes more pressing.Tito's right hand man, power hungry Alexandar Rankovic, is waiting for things to develop gradually while also preparing to assume the role of Yugoslavia's next president for life. In terms of the economy, the Market Socialist model may have served Yugoslavia well up until some years ago but now is a time of economic recession. Moreover, ethnic tensions and nationalism have been on the rise for quite some time now, with one of the largest demonstrations in Yugoslavia,Maspok or the “Croatian Spring” ,as foreign news agencies called it,taking place in the Socialist Republic of Croatia 10 years ago still being a hot topic."
egd_yugoslavia.2.t:0 "Great Expectations"
egd_yugoslavia.2.d:0 "Aleksandar Rankovic was always a power hungry man. From his days in the resistance until now he was always looking for opportunities and never did he hesitate to grab them. His presence in Yugoslav politics has been showing more in the last 2 decades, as in 1968 he was the biggest proponent of anti-economic reform. He eventually became Tito’s closest partner and now that his health is gradually worsening he is waiting to grab what he considers is rightfully his."
egd_yugoslavia.3.t:0 "Death of Tito"
egd_yugoslavia.3.d:0 "Comrade Tito has died.On the day of May 4th, 1980 at 15:05 in Ljubljana, the great heart of the President of our Socialist Yugoslavia, the President of the Presidency of Yugoslavia, the President of the League of Communists of Yugoslavia, Marshal of Yugoslavia, and the Commander-in-chief of the Yugoslav armed forces, Josip Broz Tito has stopped beating.Great sorrow and pain is shaking up the working class, nations and nationalities of our country, our every citizen, worker, soldier, war veteran, farmer, intellectual, every creator, pioneer and youth, and every girl and mother.For all his entire life. Tito was a fighter for the interests and goals of the working class, for the most humane ideals, and desires of our nations and nationalities. Tito is our dearest friend and he shall always be remembered."
egd_yugoslavia.4.t:0 "Lofty Aspirations"
egd_yugoslavia.4.d:0 "Not even a month has passed since Tito died and already the vultures have gathered to feast upon his body. Rankovic demands the leadership passed to him. Clearly a man like him should not have been allowed to gain so much power. “Tito specifically requested in the letters i present you,that i succeed him in power”, that was his announcement at the assembly of the presidency, and he refused to elaborate."
egd_yugoslavia.5.t:0 "Reckoning Without the Host"
egd_yugoslavia.5.d:0 "“But sir, the constitution clearly calls for the presidency to maintain leadership after Marshall's death…” The assembly's president responded reluctantly. "We can't just make a decision on our own." “Nonsense!” Rankovic yelled. For a brief while, the audience became silent. They couldn't prove Tito didn't write those letters, so perhaps the lunatic was correct. Guards led everyone outside, where a mob was already forming to oppose Rankovic. One thing is certain: the next few days will be critical for Yugoslavia's destiny."
egd_yugoslavia.6.t:0 "A Critical Choice"
egd_yugoslavia.6.d:0 "Second day of non-stop protests in Belgrade. News agencies from all over Europe are reporting on the situation ”President Alexandar Rankovic has suspended today’s presidium assembly, as opposition, workers, common people are gathering here outside the Yugoslav Parliament for a second day in a row. Rankovic has a decision to make, he needs to resign or push his people to the limits.” Rankovic turned the television off and sat on his chair.He peeked at his pistol inside his office’s drawer,sipped some of his whiskey without even bothering getting a glass and, thought…"
egd_yugoslavia.7.t:0 "Giving Up"
egd_yugoslavia.7.d:0 "“Coming now with a report that just came in from Yugoslavia’s capital, Belgrade, where a crisis caused by an issue regarding Jozip Broz “Tito’s”,who sadly passed a few weeks ago,successor has finally come to an end. Disputed president Aleksandar Rankovic has filed his resignation and has since been arrested by the Yugoslav authorities with charges of fraud. The opposition powers have gathered in the city’s main square where Milovan Djilas,the opposition leader, is currently giving a fiery speech”"
egd_yugoslavia.8.t:0 "Pushing On"
egd_yugoslavia.8.d:0 " He made his mind. He won’t let nobody and nothing get in his way. He is Tito’s rightful successor after all. Let them weep and wail all they want. In the end they all will kneel."
egd_yugoslavia.9.t:0 "Right Man in the Right Place"
egd_yugoslavia.9.d:0 "”Our system was built only for Tito to manage. Now that Tito is gone and our economic situation becomes critical, there will be a natural tendency for greater centralization of power. But this centralization will not succeed because it will run up against the ethnic-political power bases in the republics. This is not classical nationalism but a more dangerous, bureaucratic nationalism built on economic self-interest. This is how the Yugoslav system will begin to collapse." Djilas couldn’t even finish his sentence and the crowds started applauding. He truly was the right man in the right place and time. Men like him are  just what Yugoslavia needs right now."
egd_yugoslavia.10.t:0 "Radio Beograd:Transmission 1"
egd_yugoslavia.10.d:0 "“This is Radio Beograd, interrupting regular programm with an announcement for Belgrade residents living near the Republic Square. In response to recent anti-government demonstrations the People’s Army has mobilized armored vehicles and authorized the use of lethal force. Please remain calm,collaborate with the authorities and stay tuned as Radio Beograd will be covering the situation as it unfolds during the night hours…” Three tanks entered the main square, awaiting orders. The headquarters ordered"
egd_yugoslavia.11.t:0 "Pain,Despair,Horror"
egd_yugoslavia.11.d:0 "A small friend group is rushing through the dark allays of Belgrade. Two women and a man. He is bleeding. They take a turn and finally arrive at the Medical Academy Hospital only to be greeted with a shocking image. People bleeding out on the stairs, doctors and soldiers running up and down. “Halt!”, somebody shouts.”What are you doing, let us in he is hit and bleeding out!” One of the girls shouts while weeping. To no avail, the guard won't let them pass. They are left there helpless among helpless people."
egd_yugoslavia.12.t:0 "Radio Beograd:Transmission 2"
egd_yugoslavia.12.d:0 "“During this time of political uncertainty that put our socialist homeland in danger, the people’s army stepped in as the people’s savior each soldier swore to be.

egd_yugoslavia.13.t:0 "The Rose Protests"
egd_yugoslavia.13.d:0 "When Ali left the doorway of his apartment building, he could smell the hope in the air. He was immediately greeted by faces full of optimism and the smiling mouths of many people. Carrying banners, they were marching through the avenues of Pristina to show their support for the government of Yugoslavia and their decision to give further autonomy to the Socialist Autonomous Province of Kosovo.Loud car noises were replaced by patriotic songs, cries by laughter, and bitter history by a prosperous future. As he shut the door behind him, a young woman ran to him. She was holding a small red rose, which she pinned to Ali's coat."
egd_yugoslavia.14.t:0 "3 Cheers for the New Republic"
egd_yugoslavia.14.d:0 "Everybody in the press conference room listened silently. All cameras were pointed at the table, microphones adjusted, notebooks with pens ready to hand. All journalists were eagerly awaiting the important news Milan Djilas was carrying. Every sentence meant he was closer to the main part of this briefing."I have always believed that a system that does not function must be replaced immediately, else it leads to more troubles. Unfortunately, there are many systems in our federal republic that are nonsensical and only breed more problems and oppression. Thus the National assembly and I have made the decision, for the well-being of the people of Yugoslavia as a whole, to create and subsequently recognize the Socialist republic of Kosovo".Chatter filled the room. Many of the reporters didn't try to hide their sympathy for the decision and started clapping. A politician who enacts a promised reform?"
egd_yugoslavia.15.t:0 "May he be Damned, the Traitor of his Homeland"
egd_yugoslavia.15.d:0 "Students began gathering at the appointed hour. Since Friday night, when the riots began, the University in Pristina has been buzzing like a bustling hive, with students singing and the noises of Milisija trucks. The tear gas began to rain down about 13:45 p.m. The policemen stormed the premises, beating and detaining the students. After an hour, everything fell silent. Not a thing was heard. Nothing was mentioned in the news that night either. Nothing happened in Pristina that day at all."
egd_yugoslavia.16.t:0 "Back to Normal"
egd_yugoslavia.16.d:0 "“Cheers Gentlemen!”. Rankovic and 4 of his most trusted - Serbian - generals are gathered in his office celebrating one of the bloodiest nights Yugoslavia has ever seen. “To our greatest victory and to those still to come!” Every man in this had some doubts about that but no one dared to say anything.Yugoslavia entered a new era today."
egd_yugoslavia.17.t:0 "The Last Straw"
egd_yugoslavia.17.d:0 "With his shield clung to the line of his colleagues, Milan was shoving forward against the bodies of the massive crowd of protesting Albanian Kosovars. His hand clenched his baton, which he used as a mace to make way ahead of him. He didn't hesitate while swinging the nightstick, old, young, men or women, he didn't care. The orders were clear; maintain order. But the situation has been dire for the last hour. Milan and the riot police were losing ground rapidly. He turned behind him to find that reinforcements had arrived. ''Just in time'' he mumbled to himself. As the bus stopped, doors opened wide and men started hopping out of the automobile. To his surprise, they weren't carrying shields or nightsticks, but firearms. When he turned his head back to face the crowd, a stone hit his head. The protestors used this opportunity to breach the shield line. He fell to the ground, unable to do anything. He was left to watch. But the rapid moment of the crowd stopped the moment a round escaped the barrel of a gun. As the loud bang caught everyone's attention, a woman dropped dead."
egd_yugoslavia.18.t:0 "The Day After the Storm"
egd_yugoslavia.18.d:0 "The news of the violent suppression of the riots in Pristina horrified the entirety of Yugoslavia. The people are enraged and will not remain silent this time. Take to the streets! Each and every man,woman,youth,elderly against the man who first went against them. All major cities in Yugoslavia From Zagreb to Skopje raise their voices today in solidarity to their fellow people, responding to violence with violence. Rankovic will reap what he sows.  The situation in the republics of Bosnia,Croatia and Slovenia is worse than anywhere else, as rioters have seized government buildings and declared the republics autonomous.A joint proclamation of independence was considered during a meeting of demonstration leaders. “...And there is nothing the madmen in Belgrade can do about it!”"
egd_yugoslavia.19.t:0 "Ending it All"
egd_yugoslavia.19.d:0 "…Rankovic wasn’t as talkative lately.Locked in his office all day, I mean i understand why, with the pile of shit he got himself into. He is a lunatic that’s for sure but i can’t help but feel sorry about him. Today he came rushing to his office -with a bottle of Scotch in his hands as always- he didn’t say a word and locked himself in his office again. I did not think much of it until I heard the shot. I bursted in the office and saw him lying in a pond of blood, pistol in his hand, Scotch on the table empty. I faded, what the fuck am i supposed to do. I shouted for Janko to come check. He looked at him, looked at me and left the office running…"
egd_yugoslavia.20.t:0 "The Quiet War"
egd_yugoslavia.20.d:0 "“On the basis of the fundamental principles of natural law, the right of the Slovene nation to self-determination, on the principles of international law and the Constitution of the Republic of Slovenia, and on the basis of the absolute majority vote in the plebiscite held on March 24, 1981, the people of the Republic of Slovenia will no longer be part of the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia. On the basis of an unanimous proposal by all parliamentary parties and group of delegates and in compliance with the plebiscitary outcome, the Assembly of the Republic of Slovenia adopted the Constitutional Act on the sovereignty and independence of the Republic of Slovenia at the sessions of all its chambers on 26 June 1981”. That was what Slavko Jovic read at the emergency meeting of the Military Council. Since Rankovic’s suicide things have been only going downhill like the situation was not already a mess. “Gentlemen,” said Jovic when he was done reading “The situation calls for an immediate response, you may place your votes”  The cabinet voted and an announcement was soon made “Notify the 13th Corps…”. At another place at the same time people who used to work, celebrate and mourn together are now taking up guns to kill each other."

egd_yugoslavia.21.d:0 "Militants of unknown ethnicity stormed and sacked a Milisija station, which was being utilized as a temporary barracks by the Federal Army. They arrived in droves, with roughly three vans, and raided the station, obtaining automatic weapons, rocket-propelled grenades, and plenty of ammo. They had unrestricted access since the forces in town were only an enclave of soldiers incapable of repelling them."
egd_yugoslavia.22.t:0 "Village Burned"

YUG_head_of_the_non_aligned_world_idea:0 "Head of the Non Aligned World"
YUG_head_of_the_non_aligned_world_idea_desc:0 "One of the features of superpower diplomacy, which the world was thrown into with the beginning of the Cold war, is dividing the world into large spheres of influence in which one superpower has power over the other, and into non-aligned sectors.Despite being a socialist country, Yugoslavia decided to be in neither the Soviet nor American power block. Together with many nations, Yugoslavia formed the Non-Aligned Movement, putting Tito as the leader. There, governments try to balance the ever-growing bi-polarization of the world."
YUG_remembering_maspok_idea:0 "Remembering Maspok"
YUG_remembering_maspok_idea_desc:0 "Ethnic tensions and nationalism have been on the rise for quite some time now, with one of the largest demonstrations in Yugoslavia,Maspok or the Croatian Spring as foreign news agencies called it, taking place in the Socialist Republic of Croatia 10 years ago still being a hot topic."
YUG_errors_of_market_socialism_idea:0 "Errors of Market Socialism"
YUG_errors_of_market_socialism_idea_desc:0 "In terms of the economy, the Market Socialist model may have served Yugoslavia well up until some years ago but now is a time of economic recession, as the state and few private companies haven't been doing as well in the global market, further damaging the annual income."
YUG_pearl_of_the_adriatic_idea:0 "Pearl of the Adriatic"
YUG_pearl_of_the_adriatic_idea_desc:0 "While the Yugoslav economy might be lacking in some areas, where it shines is its tourism. Thousands of people from all across Europe travel many miles just to reach the beautiful rocky beaches of the Adriatic sea. Upon their arrival, they are more than happy to spend their money there, which brings enormous revenue to the government's pocket. Despite being immensely lucrative, the tourism economy moves in cycles, as most tourists arrive in Summer. Building the entire economy around such an unreliable source of income might not be the wisest thing to do, especially in such turbulent times."
YUG_the_quiet_war_idea:0 "The Quiet War"
YUG_the_quiet_war_idea_desc:0 "After Rankoic's suicide and the de facto collapse of the Yugoslav Federal Government,the Martial Law imposed by the JNA was not enough to contain the hatred among the peoples of Yugoslavia. Paramilitaries,The Territorial Defence and bands of all sorts of criminals roam free looting bases of the federal army and fighting it out on the Yugoslav mountains. Civilian killings,massacres and lootings take place once in while and the Federal Army has shown innability to intervene on time."
