seychelles.1.t:0 "The Situation in the Republic of the Seychelles"
seychelles.1.d:0 "Welcome to beautiful Seychelles! Following the 1977 bloodless coup d'état that removed president James Mancham, France-Albert René (aka the Boss) and the Seychelles People's Progressive Front have ruled the country as a one-party socialist state ever since. SPUP supporters have championed the party's extensive funding of education, health care and the environment. Infant mortality, literacy rate, and economic well-being continue to rise in the republic. Conversely, dissidents have characterized the SPPF rule as undemocratic. Regardless, Seychelles has so far avoided the volatile political climate and underdevelopment in neighboring island countries."
