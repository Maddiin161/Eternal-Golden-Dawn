burmawar.10.t:0 "Civil War in Burma"
burmawar.10.d:0 "The promises of the British for ethnic autonomy went, unsurprisingly, unfulfilled by the military junta which took power in 1962. General Ne Win's autarky was only worsened in the economic free fall of the late 60s, and the fires in Kachin State, Wa State and the Republic of Kawthoolei suddenly had a gallon of petrol thrown on them. Fighters from the civil war in northeast India joined forces with the KIA and KNLA, forming a national liberation front against the occupiers and their puppets.\nNow, with Gen. Win refusing to step down from power following the 8888 Uprising, the question of outright civil war has escalated to an inevitability as rebel leaders declare the independence of over half of the ethnic autonomous zones in the country. The communists in the east and the ethnic armies will not hesitate to earn their freedom, by any and all means necessary. The country is a powder keg, and the 8888 Uprising is the match to set it alight."
